4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Japan began the defence of their Asian Cup title with a lucky 2-1 win against Syria in a Group C championship match on Friday .

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
But China saw their luck desert them in the second match of the group , crashing to a surprise 2-0 defeat to newcomers Uzbekistan .

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
China controlled most of the match and saw several chances missed until the 78th minute when Uzbek striker Igor Shkvyrin took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob the ball over the advancing Chinese keeper and into an empty net .

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Oleg Shatskiku made sure of the win in injury time , hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside the area .

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The former Soviet republic was playing in an Asian Cup finals tie for the first time .

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Despite winning the Asian Games title two years ago , Uzbekistan are in the finals as outsiders .

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Two goals from defensive errors in the last six minutes allowed Japan to come from behind and collect all three points from their opening meeting against Syria .

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Takuya Takagi scored the winner in the 88th minute , rising to head a Hiroshige Yanagimoto cross towards the Syrian goal which goalkeeper Salem Bitar appeared to have covered but then allowed to slip into the net .

12
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It was the second costly blunder by Syria in four minutes .

13
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar 's goal .

14
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Nader Jokhadar had given Syria the lead with a well-struck header in the seventh minute .

15
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area for most of the game but rarely breached the Syrian defence .

16
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Bitar pulled off fine saves whenever they did .

17
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Japan coach Shu Kamo said : ' ' The Syrian own goal proved lucky for us .

18
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The Syrians scored early and then played defensively and adopted long balls which made it hard for us . '

19
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
'

20
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Japan , co-hosts of the World Cup in 2002 and ranked 20th in the world by FIFA , are favourites to regain their title here .

RUGBY UNION - CUTTITTA BACK FOR ITALY AFTER A YEAR .

24
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
ROME 1996-12-06

25
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Italy recalled Marcello Cuttitta

26
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
on Friday for their friendly against Scotland at Murrayfield more than a year after the 30-year-old wing announced he was retiring following differences over selection .

27
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Cuttitta , who trainer George Coste said was certain to play on Saturday week , was named in a 21-man squad lacking only two of the team beaten 54-21 by England at Twickenham last month .

28
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Stefano Bordon is out through illness and Coste said he had dropped back row Corrado Covi , who had been recalled for the England game after five years out of the national team .

29
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Cuttitta announced his retirement after the 1995 World Cup , where he took issue with being dropped from the Italy side that faced England in the pool stages .

30
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Coste said he had approached the player two months ago about a comeback .

31
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
" He ended the World Cup on the wrong note , " Coste said .

32
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
" I thought it would be useful to have him back and he said he would be available .

33
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I think now is the right time for him to return . "

34
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Squad : Javier Pertile , Paolo Vaccari , Marcello Cuttitta , Ivan Francescato , Leandro Manteri , Diego Dominguez , Francesco Mazzariol , Alessandro Troncon , Orazio Arancio , Andrea Sgorlon , Massimo Giovanelli , Carlo Checchinato , Walter Cristofoletto , Franco Properzi Curti , Carlo Orlandi , Massimo Cuttitta , Giambatista Croci , Gianluca Guidi , Nicola Mazzucato , Alessandro Moscardi , Andrea Castellani .

AL-AIN , United Arab Emirates 1996-12-06

37
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Two goals in the last six minutes gave holders Japan an uninspiring 2-1 Asian Cup victory over Syria on Friday .

38
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Takuya Takagi headed the winner in the 88th minute of the group C game after goalkeeper Salem Bitar spoiled a mistake-free display by allowing the ball to slip under his body .

39
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It was the second Syrian defensive blunder in four minutes .

40
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar 's goal .

41
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Syria had taken the lead from their first serious attack in the seventh minute .

42
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Nader Jokhadar headed a cross from the right by Ammar Awad into the top right corner of Kenichi Shimokawa 's goal .

43
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area and had a goal disallowed for offside in the 16th minute .

44
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
A minute later , Bitar produced a good double save , first from Kazuyoshi Miura 's header and then blocked a Takagi follow-up shot .

45
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Bitar saved well again from Miura in the 37th minute , parrying away his header from a corner .

46
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Japan started the second half brightly but Bitar denied them an equaliser when he dived to his right to save Naoki Soma 's low drive in the 53rd minute .

47
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Japan : 19 - Kenichi Shimokawa , 2 - Hiroshige Yanagimoto , 3 - Naoki Soma , 4 - Masami Ihara , 5 - Norio Omura , 6 - Motohiro Yamaguchi , 8 - Masakiyo Maezono ( 7 - Yasuto Honda 71 ) , 9 - Takuya Takagi , 10 - Hiroshi Nanami , 11 - Kazuyoshi Miura , 15 - Hiroaki Morishima ( 14 - Masayuki Okano 75 ) .

193
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Centre Jason Little will miss Australia 's end-of-tour fixture against the Barbarians at Twickenham on Saturday .

194
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Little has opted not to risk aggravating the knee injury which ruled him out of a large chunk of the tour and is replaced by fellow Queenslander Daniel Herbert .

195
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Owen Finegan has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend 's test against Wales and retains his place in the back-row ahead of Daniel Manu .

196
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The Wallabies have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their European tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide David Campese with a fitting send-off in his final match in Australian colours .

197
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The Wallabies currently have no plans to make any special presentation to the 34-year-old winger but a full house of 75,000 spectators will still gather in the hope of witnessing one last moment of magic .

198
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Campese will be up against a familiar foe in the shape of Barbarians captain Rob Andrew , the man who kicked Australia to defeat with a last-ditch drop-goal in the World Cup quarter-final in Cape Town .

199
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
" Campo has a massive following in this country and has had the public with him ever since he first played here in 1984 , " said Andrew , also likely to be making his final Twickenham appearance .

200
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
On tour , Australia have won all four tests against Italy , Scotland , Ireland and Wales , and scored 414 points at an average of almost 35 points a game .

201
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
League duties restricted the Barbarians ' selectorial options but they still boast 13 internationals including England full-back Tim Stimpson and recalled wing Tony Underwood , plus All Black forwards Ian Jones and Norm Hewitt .

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Midfielder Valentin Stefan and striker Viorel Ion of Otelul Galati and defender Liviu Ciobotariu of National Bucharest are the newcomers for the European group eight clash in Macedonia on December 14 .

217
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Iordanescu said he had picked them because of their good performances in the domestic championship in which National Bucharest are top and Otelul Galati third . "

218
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I think it 's fair to give them a chance , " he told reporters .

219
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
League title-holders Steaua Bucharest , who finished bottom of their Champions ' League group in the European Cup , have only two players in the squad .

220
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Attacking midfielder Adrian Ilie , who recently moved from Steaua to Turkish club Galatasaray , is ruled out after two yellow-card offences .

MELBOURNE 1996-12-06

236
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Australia gave Brian Lara another reason to be miserable when they beat West Indies by five wickets in the opening World Series limited overs match on Friday .

237
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Lara , disciplined for misconduct on Wednesday , was dismissed for five to extend a disappointing run of form on tour .

238
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Australia , who hold a 2-0 lead in the five-match test series , overhauled West Indies ' total of 172 all out with eight balls to spare to end a run of six successive one-day defeats .

239
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
All-rounder Greg Blewett steered his side to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 57 in 90 balls to the delight of the 42,442 crowd .

240
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Man-of-the match Blewett came to the wicket with the total on 70 for two and hit three fours during an untroubled innings lasting 129 minutes .

241
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
His crucial fifth-wicket partnership with fellow all-rounder Stuart Law , who scored 21 , added 71 off 85 balls .

242
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Lara looked out of touch during his brief stay at the crease before chipping a simple catch to Shane Warne at mid-wicket .

243
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd has apologised for Lara 's behaviour on Tuesday .

244
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He ( Lara ) had told Australia coach Geoff Marsh that wicketkeeper Ian Healy was unwelcome in the visitors ' dressing room .

245
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The Melbourne crowd were clearly angered by the incident , loudly jeering the West Indies vice-captain as he walked to the middle .

246
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It was left to fellow left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul to hold the innings together with a gritty 54 despite the handicap of an injured groin .

247
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Chanderpaul was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid being run out .

248
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Pakistan , who arrive in Australia later this month , are the other team competing in the World Series tournament .

CRICKET - LARA SUFFERS MORE AUSTRALIAN TOUR MISERY .

300
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
MELBOURNE 1996-12-06

301
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
West Indies batsman Brian Lara suffered another blow to his Australian tour , after already being disciplined for misconduct , when he was dismissed cheaply in the first limited overs match against Australia on Friday .

302
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Lara , who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy , scored five to prolong a run of poor form with the bat .

303
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The West Indies vice-captain struggled for timing during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer Tom Moody straight to Shane Warne at mid-wicket .

304
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
West Indies were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after captain Courtney Walsh won the toss and elected to bat .

305
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Lara 's outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of the Australian public against him .

306
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
As he walked to the wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of the crowd .

307
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
On several occasions during his innings , the crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him .

308
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Tour manager Clive Lloyd on Wednesday apologised for Lara 's behaviour in confronting Australia coach Geoff Marsh in the opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in the second test on Tuesday .

309
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Lloyd did not say what form the discipline would take .

310
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Lara , who holds the record for the highest score in test and first-class cricket , was unhappy about Healy 's role in the incident and questioned whether the ball had carried to the Australia keeper .

311
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Australia went on to win the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground by 124 runs to take a two-nil lead in the five-test series after Lara failed in both innings .

312
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Lara has yet to score a century since West Indies arrived in Australia five weeks ago .

313
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Both West Indies and Australia team management have played down the incident , stressing that relations between the two sides have not been adversely affected .

314
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Pakistan , who arrive next week , are the third team in the triangular World Series tournament .

ROME 1996-12-06

799
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
FIFA chairman Joao Havelange said on Friday he would personally present AC Milan George Weah with world soccer 's fair play award despite the striker 's attack on Porto captain Jorge Costa .

800
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
In an interview with the Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport , he was quoted as saying Weah had been provoked into the assault which left Costa with a broken nose .

801
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
" FIFA has named the Liberian for its 1996 Fair Play award and it is not going to change its decision , " Havelange said .

802
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
" A reaction , provoked , cannot erase 10 years of loyalty everywhere and in every competition .

803
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
" I will be happy to give him the award personally on January 20 in Lisbon and I 'm confident that Costa himself will be there beside me on that day to shake his hand . "

804
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Weah was suspended for one match by UEFA , European soccer 's governing body , pending a fuller investigation .

805
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The incident took place in the players ' tunnel after a European Champions ' League match on November 20 .

806
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Weah has admitted head butting Costa but said he reacted to racist taunts .

807
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He has offered to apologise if Costa acknowledges the provocation .

808
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Costa , who needed surgery on his nose , has not accepted the offer and was reported to be considering suing Weah .

809
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Weah served out his suspension during Milan 's 2-1 home defeat by Rosenborg of Norway on Wednesday .

810
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The defeat put the Italians out of the Europoean Cup .

815
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The two men were hit in the pelvis and leg .

816
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Police said their lives were not in danger .

817
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The fans , in Austria to watch their team play Rapid Vienna last Wednesday , may have been involved in a pub brawl earlier , the spokeswoman said .

818
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000

823

Along with leaders Vicenza , fourth-placed Bologna represent the biggest surprise of this Italian autumn .

824
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Led as usual by Swede Kennet Andersson and Russian Igor Kolyvanov in attack , Bologna can expect a tough home match against a Piacenza side still exultant after a 3-2 league win over AC Milan last Sunday .

825
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Cagliari ( 16 ) v Reggiana ( 18 ) 1530

826
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Cagliari start favourite in this relegation scrap following draws with Napoli and Inter in last two outings but will be without suspended Swiss defender Ramon Vega .

827
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Bottom team Reggiana are also without a suspended defender , German Dietmar Beiersdorfer .

Fiorentina ( 10 ) v Perugia ( 8 ) 1330

829
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Fiorentina will be without three suspended players -- defenders Daniele Carnasciali and Lorenzo Amoruso and midfielder Emiliano Bigica -- for a difficult home match against unpredictable , attack-oriented Perugia led by in-form Croat striker Milan Rapajic and the experienced Fausto Pizzi .

830
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Lazio ( 12 ) v AS Roma ( 7 ) 1930

831

Poor man 's Roman derby in what has been a miserable season for both Rome teams , already eliminated from the Italian and UEFA Cups .

832
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Lazio have injury doubts about striker Pierluigi Casiraghi , Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved and defender Paolo Negro , while Roma present a full strength side led by Argentine Abel Balbo , Marco Delvecchio and Francesco Totti in attack .

833
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
AC Milan ( 9 ) v Udinese ( 11 ) 1330

834
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Can Milan sink any further ?

835
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Following their midweek Champions ' League elimination by Norwegian side Rosenborg , a morale-boosting win is badly needed .

836
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Liberian striker George Weah makes a welcome return for Milan alongside Roberto Baggio , with Montenegrin Dejan Savicevic in midfield .

837
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Good news for Milan is that Udinese 's German striker Oliver Bierhoff is out through injury .

838
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Napoli ( 5 ) v Verona ( 17 ) 1330

839
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
In-form Napoli should prove too strong for second from bottom Verona despite the absence of their suspended Argentine defender Roberto Ayala .

840
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Verona 's slim chances have been further reduced by a knee injury to their experienced midfielder Eugenio Corini .

841
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Parma ( 14 ) v Atlalanta ( 15 ) 1330

842
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Parma may field new signing , Croat midfielder Mario Stanic , in an attempt to lift a miserable season which has seen them go without a win since a 1-0 triumph over Cagliari eight weeks ago .

843
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Parma 's French midfielder Daniel Bravo and defender Fabio Cannavaro are suspended while Argentine Nestor Sensini is out through injury .

844

Atalanta look to Filippo Inzaghi , scorer of eight goals .

845
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Sampdoria ( 6 ) v Juventus ( 3 ) 1330

846
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
All-conquering Juventus field their most recent signing , Portuguese defender Dimas , while Alessandro Del Piero and Croat Alen Boksic lead the attack .

847
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The new world club champions may prove too strong for a Sampdoria side led by captain Roberto Mancini but missing injured French midfielder Pierre Laigle .

848
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Vicenza ( 1 ) v Internazionale ( 2 ) 1330

849
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Not exactly a clash of the titans but an intriuguing match nonetheless .

850
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Full strength Vicenza , led by Uruguayan Marcelo Otero , may continue their surprise run at the top against an Inter side that has been less than impressive in three successive home draws .

851
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Inter will be without suspended French defender Joceyln Angloma and injured Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano .

DURBAN , South Africa 1996-12-06

881
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
At least four people have been shot dead in two suspected political attacks in South Africa 's volatile Zulu heartland , police said on Friday .

882
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
A police spokesman said two youths believed to be supporters of President Nelson Mandela 's African National Congress ( ANC ) had been killed when unknown gunmen opened fire at the rural settlement of Izingolweni on KwaZulu-Natal province 's south coast on Thursday night .

883
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The victims were 18 and 20 , he said , adding one other youth had been wounded in the shooting .

884
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
In another attack , also on the province 's south coast on Thursday night , two men were shot dead near Umkomaas .

885
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
" We suspect that these killings are linked to politics , " spokesman Bala Naidoo told Reuters .

886
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
There had been no arrests .

887
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The killings came just hours after violence monitors said they were not optimistic of a peaceful festive season in KwaZulu-Natal and pointed the south coast region where 18 people were massacred last Christmas as one of potential hot spots .

888
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
They said the recent lull in political feuding could be upset as thousands of migrant workers , some tense with grudges brewed in the cities and keen to settle old scores , flock back to their home villages .

889
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
More than 14,000 people have lost their lives in over a decade of political turf wars between the ANC and Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi 's Inkatha Freedom Party in the province .

Czech President Vaclav Havel on Friday welcomed the appointment of Madeleine Albright , who is of Czech extraction , as the United States ' first woman Secretary of State .

894
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
In a statement Havel , who is recovering from cancer surgery , said : " Madeleine Albright is a distinguished friend , a tested diplomat , and a true American of fine origins . "

895
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
" I look forward to continuing our good relations ...

896

with the United States and with the first woman ever to hold the position of Secretary of State .

897
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I wish her well , " Havel said in a statement to Reuters .

898
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Havel , who helped lead the " velvet revolution " that ousted the Communist regime in Prague in 1989 , invited Albright , then working for a private foreign policy think tank , to advise his new democratic government in 1990 .

899
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000

Albright , born Marie Korbelova to a Czechoslovak diplomat in 1937 , fled with her family to the United States after the Communists came to power in a coup in 1948 .

" The nomination ...

904

is a clear signal that one key of the lines of foreign policy will be the strengthening of the trans-Atlantic cooperation , a creation of strategic partnership between Europe and the US , " Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told Reuters .

CZECH VICE-PM SEES WIDER DEBATE AT PARTY CONGRESS .

PRAGUE 1996-12-06

918
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Saturday 's national congress of the ruling Czech Civic Democratic Party ( ODS ) will discuss making the party more efficient and transparent , Foreign Minister and ODS vice-chairman Josef Zieleniec , said on Friday .

919
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
" Modernisation and more profesionalism of the party 's structure , having financing of the party be more transparent ...

920
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
are absolutely fundamental , " Zieleniec , who is also vice-premier in the government , told Reuters .

921
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
He said after June general elections in which the ruling three-party coalition lost its parliamentary majority , the ODS executive , led by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus , had developed proposals on these subjects to present at the congress on Saturday in the Czech second city Brno .

922
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
" I am convinced , that the congress will tackle these proposals , " he said .

923
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The ODS , a party in which Klaus often tries to emulate the style of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , has been in control of Czech politics since winning general elections in 1992 .

924
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Zieleniec in the summer led calls for the party and its leadership to listen to more diverse opinions , a thinly-veiled criticism of Klaus who has spearheaded the country 's post-Communist economic reforms .

925
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The party , led by the vigorously-confident Klaus , took 32 of 81 seats after late November runoff elections to the new upper house of Czech parliament .

926
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But after the first round vote a week before , the ODS had the potential to win as many 79 seats .

927
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Klaus and his coalition lost its majority in parliament in June lower house elections after the left-wing opposition consolidated , putting the centre-left Social Democrats in a strong second-place position .

932
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Poland said on Friday that Swiss bank accounts , which in many cases belonged to Polish Jews who died in the Holocaust , were used in debt settlements between the two countries after the World War Two .

933
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati , unveiling first findings of a special government commission , said that in 1970s the then communist Poland received 460,000 Swiss francs from the accounts .

934
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
" In 1970s , Poland received from unclaimed accounts in Switzerland a sum of 460,000 francs .

935
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What was its right ( to the money ) ...I do not know , " Rosati told a news conference .

936
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Switzerland stands accused by Senator Alfonse D'Amato , chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate Banking Committee , of agreeing to give money to Poland from unclaimed bank accounts of Polish citizens , as part of an accord on compensating Swiss nationals whose assets had been seized in communist Poland .

937
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Many of these citizens were Jews murdered during the war , when Nazi German invaders killed most of Poland 's 3.5 million Jews .

938
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Rosati did not say whether the payment in 1970s was part of the 1949 agreement between Warsaw and Switzerland on compensation to Swiss citizens whose assets were seized by the Soviet-imposed communists authorities after World War Two .

939
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
" I expect that the commission will finish gathering information within two to three weeks and then more details will be provided , " Rosati said .

940
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Rosati confirmed that the 1949 agreement had provided for granting Switzerland about 53 million francs and most of this sum was repaid with coal exports .

941
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
He said , however , that Switzerland did get about 16,000 francs from the so-called " dead accounts " as part of the compensation .

942
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
" About 16,000 francs were seized from accounts of four or five Polish citizens , whose data we do not precisely know .

943
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
The issue is of moral and legal nature , because its financial significance is small , " Rosati said .

944
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Under pressure from international Jewish organisations , Swiss government has devised a plan to pay out millions of dollars in unclaimed bank accounts as a conciliatory gesture toward Holocaust victims .

945
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The conservative Radical Democrats ( FDP ) have said they would ask parliament next week to order Swiss banks to put some 40 million Swiss francs ( $ 31 million ) in dormant wealth into a fund earmarked for Jewish groups and charitable organisations .

946
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But Swiss banks and the country 's Jewish community voiced doubts whether the plan would work .

950
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Polish brewer Zywiec 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said .

951
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround .

952
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So far this year Zywiec , whose full name is Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA , has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys .

953
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres .

954
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer .

955
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
" The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable , " van Boxmeer said on Polish per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres .

956
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make Poland , with its 40-million population , Europe 's third largest beer market after Germany and Britain .

957
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Van Boxmeer said Poland 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors .

958
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Zywiec is 31.8-percent owned by Heineken while Carlsberg has the same amount in Okocim .

959
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Earlier this year South African Breweries Ltd ( SAB ) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted Lech and Tychy brewers , which together hold more than 20 percent of the market , and Australia 's Brewpole BV has a controlling stake in Poland 's larges t brewery , Elbrewery Company Ltd. ( EB ) .

960
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Van Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to the pressure on the firm 's margins .

961
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share .

962
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic .

963
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998 , but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market 's overcapacity .

964
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
" I think Polish consumers in general are quite proud of their beers -- and I 'm speaking about all the brands -- and as we make good beers ...

965
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech beers , " he said .

966
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Van Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim , which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year , but that Zywiec 's potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one .

967
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand , Zywiec Full Light , which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country 's largest-selling brand .

968
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
" You will not win the war of the Polish beer market with imported international brands , " van Boxmeer said , adding that Heineken would remain an up-market import in Poland .

969
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Van Boxmeer also said Zywiec would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm 's overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made .

LONDON 1996-12-06

1011
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The British government warned Friday that it would refer the proposed trans-Atlantic alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines to Britain 's Monopolies and Mergers Commission unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions .

1012
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines , final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between Britain and the United States to liberalise trans-Atlantic air traffic , which would create greater competition on the routes .

1013
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Lang said he supported conditions proposed by Britain 's Office of Fair Trading , which was asked to examine the case last month .

1014
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
" I agree ... that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers , on those routes where BA and AA currently compete and for all passengers on the trans-Atlantic market route between the UK and U.S. , " he said .

1015
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
His comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in London with no deal signed .

1016
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the British Airways-American deal would be cleared .

1017
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that British Airways and American drop 168 slots at London Heathrow airport , the busiest in Europe .

1018
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
American 's parent , AMR Corp. , said it did not view the terms as a " deal breaker . "

1019
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
However , it called the conditions " more severe " than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances .

1020
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
British Airways 's initial response was that " unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value . "

1021
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It added that it would be " prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition . "

1022
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The government also wants British Airways to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir that bars it from competing on trans-Atlantic routes , and said both British Airways and American should be prepared to reduce services on the London to Dallas-Fort Worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter .

1023
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It also suggested losing some slots on the London-to-Boston route .

1024
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000

LONDON 1996-12-06

1028
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Mediterranean oil products were steady to mostly lower on Friday after Elf refinery workers voted to end their nine-day strike .

1029
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Gas oil erased Thursday 's gains , plunging $ 5.50 a tonne in line with the screen .

1030
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Volume was very thin and market remained long , with premiums down $ 1 at about high cif quotes +$0.50 basis Genoa . "

1031
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The sharp moves on the screen make everyone nervous , " a trader said .

1032
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Trades were discussed in 0.2 , 0.5 and one percent heating oil into Syria and Lebanon and there were fresh inquiries from France and Spain for low sulphur diesel .

1033
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Interest remains focussed on a tender by India for a second purchase of high speed diesel for January delivery .

1034
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Fuel oil lost ground sharply with weaker crude , but also suffered from some pricing pressure .

1035
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
High sulphur cracked fuel lost about $ 3 to $ 109-111 fob Med with several cargoes threatening to overhang the market .

1036
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The chance of material heading north , talked earlier this week , may be in jeopardy now since American fuel oil is expected to head transatlantic following outages at two coking units in the U.S .

1037
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Up to 165,000 tonnes of fuel will have to find a new home and with the arbitrage from the U.S. to Europe open Rotterdam is a prime candidate .

1038
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Low sulphur prices were lower with cif Med pegged in the mid to low $ 140s .

1039
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Gasoline prices fell after striking Elf refinery workers voted to go back to work , traders said .

1040
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But an open arbitrage to the U.S. and tight Italian supplies after Elf scooped up Med material over the last week , continued to underpin prices into next week .

A boy has died from meningitis and a girl from the same school has contracted the disease in the second such scare to hit Britain in as many weeks , health authorities said on Friday .

1044
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
The 16-year-old who attended Sale Grammar School in the northern England city of Manchester died less than a day after becoming ill .

1045
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The 15-year-old girl is also suffering from the disease and hospital officials described her condition as serious .

1046
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
" At the moment there is no evidence the two cases are linked .

1047
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
However , we are assuming they are as a precaution for the time being , " a spokeswoman said .

1048
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The more than 1,260 students at the school are being given antibiotics as a precaution .

Wales grappled with its own cluster of meningitis cases on a university campus in Cardiff .

1050

At least two people have died and hundreds have been vaccinated in an effort to contain the virus .

1051
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
In Scotland , eight people have died and hundreds more are fighting a widespread food-poisoning outbreak .

1052

A health authority spokeswoman said 78 people suspected of having the disease , including 64 confirmed cases , were still being treated .

British Prime Minister John Major 's office said on Friday that rebel Conservative MP Sir John Gorst had not " resigned the whip " ( quit the parliamentary party ) and the government still had a majority in the 651-seat parliament .

1058

The government still has a majority , " a spokesman from Major 's office in Downing Street said .

1060
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Gorst 's office said later the MP would not feel himself obliged to vote with the government .

1061
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
He said at one point during a press conference : " I have seen my whip ( party manager ) for next week which , of course , does n't mean very much to me now . "

1062
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Before Gorst 's statement , Major had a one-seat majority in the 651-seat House of Commons lower house of parliament .

1063
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
In his formal statement , Gorst said : " I am today withdrawing my cooperation from the government and shall not treat the " whip ' as either a summons to attend the House of Commons or as placing me under any obligation to vote as advised . "

1064
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Gorst resigned over a hospital closure in his constituency .

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

1139
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
New York City on Friday said that it planned a $ 775 million refunding for January that will include its first floating rate issue of taxable debt for European investors .

1140
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
A city official , who declined to be named , explained that Goldman , Sachs , which this summer was demoted to the second tier of the syndicate , proposed the floating rate issue and as a result was promoted to book runner for this offering .

1141
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
By selling the floating rate debt , the city hopes to establish a benchmark , the city official said , adding that it needed a large deal to accomplish this objective .

1142
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The city in late June sold its first issue of Euronotes , a strategy that it says saved it $ 500,000 in interest costs , and it has been trying to build on this strategy of expanding the pool of potential investors since then .

1143
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
In November , New York City said it became the first U.S. municipality to offer bonds for sale in European markets by competitive bidding as it listed taxable bonds on the London Stock Exchange .

1144

Homestake Mining Co tops Wall Street 's list as the most likely white knight buyer for Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp if Santa Fe rejects unsolicited suitor Newmont Mining Corp .

1155
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Santa Fe is so far mum on the more than $ 2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from Newmont , announced Thursday .

1156
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Wall Street , since the bid , has speculated that any deal between Newmont and Santa Fe would be a " bear hug , " or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor .

1157
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Newmont said the companies have had previous contact , though declined to detail the encounters .

1158
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Analysts predict Santa Fe will go to the highest bidder , and that if a rival buyer is found , Newmont may not be able to match its offer .

1159
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
They said the Santa Fe deal , which includes desirable Nevada mining territory , would only payoff for Newmont longer term .

1160
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Newmont , in fact , will not benefit from the Santa Fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years , which also limits its capacity to raise its offer .

1161
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Any deal , friendly or hostile , would almost assuredly be a stock swap , which is necessary to preserve the tax-free , pooling-of-interest accounting , they said .

1162
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out Barrick Gold Corp and Bre-X Minerals Ltd as Santa Fe saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting Indonesia 's Busang vast gold deposit .

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Placer Dome Inc too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match Santa Fe 's Nevada , South America and Central Asia presence , they said .

1164

A Homestake spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops the list .

Santa Fe is headquartered Albuquerque , N.M. and reported 1995 earnings of $ 0.30 per share , or $ 40 million , on revenues of $ 350 million .

1168
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Santa Fe has mining and exploration operations in Nevada , California , Montana , Canada , Brazil , Australia , Chile , Kazakstan , Mexico and Ghana .

1169
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
PaineWebber analyst Marc Cohen said he lowered his rating on Newmont to neutral from attractive today because if Newmont merged with Santa Fe , investors would have to wait until the second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion .

1170
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
" I think Homestake could come in as a white knight , but how much is someone willing to come in above the Newmont number .

1171
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
One would have to outbid by at least 15 percent , but there is going to be a ( Santa Fe ) deal with someone , " he said .

1172
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
" Longer term , two to three years out , ( a Newmont-Santa Fe deal ) is positive , it does all the right things .

1173
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But in the near-term it is , at worst , neutral , " the analyst added .

1174
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Newmont proposed to Santa Fe a stock-swap merger at a ratio of 0.33 Newmont shares for each Santa Fe shares .

1175
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
In Friday New York Stock Exchange trade , Newmonth was off 1/2 to 46-5/8 while Santa Fe added 1/4 to 15-1/8 .

1176
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
" Newmont said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with Santa Fe , which is almost always a euphemism for ' We have more money in our pocket , ' " said an arb , referring to a possible sweetened bid from Newmont .

1177
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Two other arbs called Newmont 's move a " a 32 cent bid " because there is no formal tender offer , only the proposal letter " mailed " to Santa Fe 's board .

NAIROBI 1996-12-06

1191
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The Canadian general in charge of a multinational force for eastern Zaire said on Friday he was going back to Zaire for more information about the plight of about 165,000 Rwandan refugees adrift in the countryside .

1192
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril told a news conference in Nairobi his main concern was for a large group of about 150,000 refugees living off the land in a valley about 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of the eastern city of Goma .

1193
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
If he decided it was necessary and safe for the aircrew , he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for the refugees , even against the wishes of the government in Kinshasa and the Zairean rebels who control much of eastern Zaire , he said .

1194
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
" Tomorrow I 'm going into Rwanda and my intention is to go across into eastern Zaire and try to find out for the second time what the situation is on the ground , " he said .

1195
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
General Baril saw rebel leader Laurent Kabila in Goma last week but the rebels told him the crisis was over because most of the Rwandan refugees have already gone home .

1196
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The rebels do not want the multinational force to deploy on the ground , for fear it might help the Zairean army regain control of the area .

1197
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Kinshasa opposes airdrops , apparently because the food could fall into the hands of the rebels and their local supporters .

1198
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Canadian Defence Minister Doug Young said on Thursday that the multinational force would probably not have to make food airdrops or intervene militarily in any major way .

1199
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
" It does n't look as though they ( airdrops ) are going to be required in any significant way because the NGOs ( non-governmental organisations ) are in that area on the border between Zaire and Rwanda , " Young told reporters .

1200
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But General Baril said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information .

1201
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
" We hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access ( to the large group of refugees ) with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies .

1202
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
" If they ca n't move because they are too weak , then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means ( airdrops ) ...It 's complex , it 's dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary .

1203
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
If it is necessary , I wo n't hesitate to use it , " he said .

1204
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Asked if he would disregard the objections of the Zairean government , he said : " It would have to be in the last resort .

1205
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It would have to mean that tens of thousands of lives are in danger .

1206
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Do you think that I would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time ?

1207
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And my mandate is also under Chapter Seven to operate in eastern Zaire . "

1208
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Under Chapter Seven of the U.N. charter , the Security Council has wide powers to preserve peace and security .

1209
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
" I know their ( the Zairean government 's ) position and I know it 's very delicate and we are very sensitive to their position also , " the general added .

1210
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
He denied that his contacts , criticised by Kinshasa , with the Zairean rebels amounted to negotiations .

1211
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
" I do n't negotiate , " he said . "

1212
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I coordinate with those who are holding ground and that 's a wise thing to do .

1213
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
When we do n't know where the front is , we do n't know what the risk is . "

1214
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Baril said that apart from the group of 150,000 , U.S. and British reconnaissance plans had tracked two much smaller groups of refugees -- one of up to 1,000 north of the town of Masisi and one of up to 8,000 on the road from Bukavu west to Kindu .

1215
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The Kisangani office of the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres said on Friday that more than 100,000 refugees were trekking northwest from the Goma-Bukavu area and many of them were now in the town of Walikale .

1216
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The general did not mention these refugees , who are on the outer limit of the strip the planes have been checking .

With violence spiralling out of control , France voiced backing for the elected Bangui government but said its troops based in the former colony under defence pacts would not help it combat army mutineers .

" France cannot be involved in the domestic political debate , " President Jacques Chirac told a news conference at the end of a Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso .

Witnesses said they had been seized by troops loyal to President Ange-Felix Patasse at dawn on Thursday when they clashed with soldiers staging a mutiny since November 16 .

1246
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Grelombe is from the Yakoma tribe to which most of the rebel soldiers belong .

1247
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
The uprising began over pay demands but has turned into a campaign to topple Patasse , sparking ethnic violence and dividing the capital .

1248

The former minister and his son had been taken from their home close to the presidential palace , which is guarded by loyalist soldiers backed by French troops based in Bangui .

1255

Chirac said Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore would visit Bangui " in the coming hours " with the heads of state of Gabon , Mali and Chad to try and establish dialogue between authorities and rebels .

1257
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000

1262
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Patasse offered concessions and amnesty to rebels before the May rebellion ended after rebels looted the city centre .

1263
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Rebels accuse Patasse of tribalism and of arming his civilian supporters and hired guns from Sudan and Chad .

1264
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Mutineers have vowed to disarm all civilians and to chase out the foreign forces knwon as Codos .

The defendant denied the charges , saying his action was intended to urge the authorities to give him a $ 20,000 loan .

WARSAW 1996-12-06

1296
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Poland 's ex-communist President Aleksander Kwasniewski is likely to visit Polish-born Pope John Paul in early 1997 despite uneasy relations between the Vatican and Warsaw , the foreign minister said on Friday .

1297
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
" President Kwasniewski plans to visit Italy on a invitation from President Oscar Scalfaro .

1298
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
A meeting with the Pope is also planned , " Dariusz Rosati told a news conference .

1299
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Rosati said that the atmosphere of the meeting , if it takes place , would largely depend on the progress in talks on ratification of a treaty between Warsaw and the Vatican .

@

1301
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The ratification of the treaty , which was signed in 1993 by the then right-centrist government , is being delayed by an ex-communist party , which won parliamentary elections in the same year and now dominates parliament .

1302
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
The party , the Democratic Left Alliance , says the agreement would give the Catholic Church too much influence over life in Poland and could infringe on rights of other religious groups and non-believers .

1303
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The relations with the Vatican have also been soured by a recent relaxation of Poland 's anti-abortion rules , which Kwasniewski signed into law last month .

1307
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Russian Finance Minister Alexander Livshits warned financially-troubled Norilsk Nickel on Friday that it must pay overdue taxes , but analysts said the firm would not be liquidated or that its would assets would be frozen .

1308
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
" Norilsk really is a big debtor , both to the federal and regional budgets , " said Konstantin Chernyshev , equities analyst at Moscow brokerage Rinaco Plus and a Norilsk watcher . "

1309
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Livshits 's words are an attempt to put pressure on the company . "

1310
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The official Itar-Tass news agency quoted Livshits as telling parliamentary deputies that RAO Norilsky Nikel 0#NKEL.RUO had to pay its tax arrears and that bankruptcy procedures applied to the metals group .

1311
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
" If it was an unsolicited statement and a bolt out of the blue , then it obviously means something , " said Christopher Granville , chief economist at United City Bank in Moscow .

1312
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
" But if it was a response to a deputy 's question that was essentially loaded , then it was the only answer he could have given . "

1313
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Russian tax and cabinet authorities , under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to boost tax revenues as a condition for receiving payments of a $ 10 billion , three-year loan to Moscow , have been striking fear into the hearts of some of Russia 's most prominent industrial firms by saying they must pay up or face liquidation .

1314
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
" They could freeze metal , but it 's not a long-term solution to the problem and would n't put money in the budget , " Chernyshev said . "

1315
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I do n't think they would do that . "

1316
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Entire social infrastructures in the icy Far North where Norilsk is based depend on the company , and Moscow has said it has no finances to resettle hundreds of thousands of people -- an expenditure which could far outstrip Norilsk 's debts .

1317
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Norilsk officials declined to comment .

1318
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Analysts said the government , while anxious about Norilsk 's debts , is highly unlikely to bring the nickel , copper , cobalt , platinum and platinum group metals producer to its knees or take measures that could significantly affect output .

1319
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But it also wants Norilsk , the world 's second-largest nickel producer , to clean up its act .

1320
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
" The procedure of bankruptcy will be applied , " Tass quoted Livshits as telling Duma deputies about Norilsk .

1321
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It indirectly quoted him as saying Norilsk should first pay salary arrears , which in the past have led to worker strikes .

1322
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
" It is unlikely that Norilsk will pay these debts in the near-term -- the company will remain a debtor in the near future , " Chernyshev said .

1323
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
He estimated the company 's regional debts at least one trillion roubles and said 30 percent of the giant Krasnoyarsk regional budget was fuelled by Norilsk money .

1324
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Norilsk 's new majority shareholder , Russian commerical bank Uneximbank , has said it is reorganising metal exports through Interrosimpex in order to boost revenues .

1325
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But the changes have yet to improve significantly Norilsk 's situation .

1326
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
" Uneximbank has inherited a mountain and whether or not they climb out and over it remains to be seen , " said one metals source .

1327
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Norilsk said in September that it total debts , including unpaid salaries to workers , were 13 trillion roubles .

1328
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The company said last month that it had worked out a tax payment schedule with authorities , after regional tax officials threatened to seize some nickel and copper assets .

1346
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Interfax , outlining Albright 's biography , pointed out that she had defended Washington 's interests fiercely as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and that this had included actively supporting NATO 's plans to expand eastwards .

1347
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000

1410
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The number of plastic surgeries in Brazil has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 , Farid Hakme , the president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society ( SBCP ) , said .

1411
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The number of operations on men increased even more -- by 80 percent , from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 , he said .

1412
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000

Our statistics are the highest for everything , " Hakme said .

1414
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
" We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market .

1415

People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market , given the profound changes in Latin America 's economy . "

00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
A controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery .

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Hakme attributes Brazil 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country 's mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies . "

1421

What happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs , " he said .

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Brazil 's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each .

1423
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants .

1424
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
" The women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the United States , " SBCP Vice-President Oswaldo Saldanha said . "

Beauty ideals and cultures are different in every country . "

1426
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Plastic surgery scares like the case in which Brazilian model Claudia Liz fell into a coma after being anaesthetised for a liposuction in October are not much of a deterrent .

1427
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Saldanha said operations fell 30 percent immediately after that case but the rate was back to normal now .

Rio de Janeiro state university officials discovered students were paying 15,000 reais ( $ 14,563 ) for the special watches , which operated like a telephone pager to receive correct answers , O Globo said .

1465
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Chile hopes to broaden the treaty signed in 1994 beyond reduction of tariffs on imports and exports and add provisions covering services and investment codes , said Aninat .

1466
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Both areas tend to more laden with friction in free trade negotiations than tariff reduction .

1467
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
' ' In January or February , we 'll have some very close contacts with Mexico to add the issue of services and advance on the issue of investments , ' ' Aninat told reporters after signing a free trade deal with Canada .

1468
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
' ' We want to give the treaty between Mexico and Chile greater depth and coverage than it has now .

1469

It 's very good now , but it practically only covers trade in goods , ' ' he said .

1470

Aninat also said he was confident the Chilean Congress would ratify the treaty with Congress quickly .

DILI , East Timor 1996-12-06

1475
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
East Timorese Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo left Dili on Friday on his way to Norway for the awards ceremony as co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize .

1476
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Witnesses said Belo left the territory for the Indonesian capital Jakarta accompanied by five other people .

1477
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It was not immediately known when he would arrive in Oslo .

1478
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The bishop will jointly receive the Nobel award next Tuesday with East Timorese-born activist Jose Ramos Horta , who lives in self-exile in Australia .

1479
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
The Indonesian government has condemned the inclusion of Ramos Horta in the award , and Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on Friday that Indonesia would not be represented officially at the ceremony in the Norwegian capital .

1480
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
" I sincerely believe that this unfortunate choice in giving the honour to such a controversial figure as Ramos Horta ...

1481
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
will exacerbate the problem in finding a solution ( to East Timor ) , " Alatas said on Friday .

1482
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
He was responding to questions at a news conference called to discuss next week 's ministerial meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) in Jakarta .

1483
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Ramos Horta has been a vocal leader of the opposition to Jakarta 's rule in the territory .

1484
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Belo and Ramos Horta were awared the prize for their efforts to secure a peaceful solution to the issue of East Timor , a former Portuguese colony which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year .

1485
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
The United Nations has never recognised Jakarta 's move .

1486
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Alatas said the government 's position on the Nobel Peace Prize would have been different if it had been awarded solely to Belo .

1487
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Asked if the Indonesian ambassador to Norway would have attended the ceremony if only Belo had been involved , Alatas replied : " Probably , yes , but that is a hypothetical question . "

1488
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Alatas said on Tuesday that on his way back from Oslo , Belo would visit the Vatican to see the Pope , and would also meet German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn .

1489
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Kohl had wanted to meet Belo during the chancellor 's official visit to Indonesia last month , but the bishop was too busy in East Timor to come to Jakarta .

1500
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
They said police and troops used water cannons from fire engines to subdue about 120 university students sitting in at the centre of the junction at about 3 a.m. before they moved in to round them up .

1501
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
The students , who had staged an 11-hour protest at the junction in northern Rangoon , were taken away in three vehicles .

1502
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The witnesses said some of the students were hit with batons while they were herded onto the vehicles and it was believed they were taken to the Insein prison in suburban Rangoon .

1503
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
The protesting students , mostly from Rangoon University , were demanding the right to organise independent unions on campuses and the release of about 80 student leaders currently in jail .

1504
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
They were among 500 students who started demonstrating at the intersection on late Friday afternoon .

About 200 Burmese students marched briefly from troubled Yangon Institute of Technology in northern Rangoon on Friday towards the University of Yangon six km ( four miles ) away , and returned to their campus , witnesses said .

1510
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Seven truckloads of armed riot police and three fire engines were on standby at one of the junctions near the institute .

1511
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
There were no clashes .

1512
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
" They are now back in the YIT campus , " an institute official who declined to be identified told Reuters by telephone .

1513
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
One of two roads leading to the University of Yangon from the institute had been closed by authorities .

1514
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But about 300 university students were still gathered outside the gates of their campus , witnesses said .

1515
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
They were singing peacefully .

1516
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
On Monday and Tuesday , students from the institute and the university launched protests against what they said was unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in October .

1517
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
On Tuesday and Wednesday , opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was restricted to her home by the military government to prevent her from being drawn into the protests .

1518
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
She was allowed to move freely on Thursday .

1519
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
The protest culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred students being detained briefly by police in central Rangoon .

1520
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
The street protests were the biggest seen in the capital since the student-led pro-democracry demonstrations of September 1988 when the junta crushed the uprising .

1521
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Thousands were killed or imprisoned .

1522
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Earlier on Friday some of the students , who were held briefly by police during the protests earlier this week , said they were still dissatisfied with the military government .

1523
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
They told Reuters they were unhappy that the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) had not heeded their calls for the right to organise independent unions on campus .

1524
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
" We still want government answers to our demands .

1525
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
We want police punishment to be published in newspapers , " one student said .

1526
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
But the students stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy ( NLD ) .

1527
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Suu Kyi , a Nobel laureate and daughter of independence hero Aung San , and key NLD officials have also denied any link with the students .

1528
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
But they have said both parties had a " moral link " in that they were against police brutality and injustice .

1529
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
The students also demanded the government announce punishments meted out to policemen who they said had manhandled students involved in a brawl with some restaurant owners near the Yangon institute in October .

1530
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
The students appealed to the government not to close the institute because of their latest demonstration .

1531
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
The institute was shut for nearly two years after the 1988 uprising .

1532
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
On Friday , the road leading to Suu Kyi 's lakeside residence in central Rangoon remained closed by police .

1535
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
International trade union leaders on Friday expressed outrage that the head of the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) had been barred from speaking at next week 's WTO meeting in Singapore .

1536
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Bill Jordan , general secretary of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( ICFTU ) , told a news conference the withdrawal of a WTO invitation to ILO director general Michel Hansenne was " outrageous behaviour on the part of an organisation that wants to command respect in the world " .

1537
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Jordan said a small group of developing nations that oppose linking trade talks and labour conditions had pressured World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) officials to prevent Hansenne from taking the platform to urge such links .

1538
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
" It is to their shame that those who are responsible for encouraging this meeting responded ( to the pressure ) in silencing him , " Jordan said after the opening of an ICFTU conference on international labour standards and trade .

1539
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The three-day trade union conference in Singapore hopes to push labour issues onto the WTO agenda .

1540
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Jordan said the WTO 's credibility was at stake over the issue of trade and labour .

1541
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The ICFTU said it wanted the WTO conference beginning on Monday to outlaw forced and child labour , end discrimination in hiring , and guarantee the right to join a union .

1542
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Bill Brett , chairman of the ILO Workers Group , told Reuters before the news conference he was " not too surprised , but very disappointed " that the speaking invitation had been withdrawn .

1543
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
" Some governments are very determined to stop the issue ( of trade and labour rights ) being discussed , " he said , adding that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) seemed particularly hostile to the ILO agenda .

1544
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
ASEAN groups Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam .

1545
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
The ILO wants a trade and labour rights " social clause " included in the final ministerial statement issued by WTO leaders at the end of the meeting , the organization 's first ministerial-level gathering .

1546
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Speaking to ICFTU delegates , Richard Eglin , director of the WTO secretariat , said the WTO was capable of making a significant contribution to governmental efforts to solve social problems .

1547
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
But he said the WTO 's organisational structure made it difficult to impose on its members a social clause such as that called for by the ILO .

K.J. Matthew said at the Asia Rubber Markets meeting here Indian production of natural rubber in 1996/97 will reach 547,000 tonnes against projected demand of 578,000 tonnes , a gap of 31,000 tonnes .

1552
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
For synthetic rubber , production reached 68,200 tonnes in 1995/96 while consumption in the same season hit 134,085 tonnes , Matthew added .

1553
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
" Though schemes designed to realise further increases in the production of natural rubber are being operated successfully , the demand-supply gap is expected to widen , " he said .

1554
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Indian synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes .

1555
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Matthew estimates that by the 2000/01 season , the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11 .

1556
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Natural rubber production will go up to 695,000 tonnes in 2000/01 against consumption of 746,000 tonnes .

1557
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
In 2010/11 , domestic demand should rise further to 1.233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914,000 tonnes .

1558
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
One way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the Rubber Board official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although Matthew said this may not be possible at this time in India .

1559
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
" The development objective for the rubber plantation industry will be to increase production to the best extent possibly with a view to minimising imports of natural rubber , " he said .

1564
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Comments by Japan 's tight-lipped central bank chief and an influential top bureaucrat are further signs that the nation 's authorities want to keep the dollar at current levels , market sources said on Friday .

1565
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
In a rare expression of a view on currencies by the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) governor , Yasuo Matsushita was quoted in Japan 's leading economic daily on Friday as saying that he sees no further , immediate fall in the yen .

1566
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
This followed a widely watched television appearance late on Thursday by Eisuke Sakakibara , a high-ranking Finance Ministry official , who denied he had said he wants to guide the dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen .

1567
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
But many in the market thought Sakakibara 's real intentions lay elsewhere , and took more notice of his comments about the U.S. government 's stance on the dollar , dealers said .

1568
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
" I think his views on ( U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert ) Rubin 's comments were indeed what he himself thinks about the dollar , " said Hank Note , chief dealer at Sumitomo Bank .

1569
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Asked about Rubin 's comment that a strong dollar was in U.S. interests , Sakakibara said the remark does not necessarily mean the United States supports a stronger dollar .

1570
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
" It 's a strong dollar , not stronger .

1571
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
In that sense , the comments are not pointing to a certain direction , " he said .

1572
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
" It shows that Sakakibara is not for a stronger dollar either , " said Sumitomo 's Note .

1573
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Takao Sakoh , first vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Tokyo , said : " Maybe a dollar at 104.50 yen is not acceptable ( to Sakakibara ) , but it may be okay at the current level , at the lower end of 112 yen . "

1574
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Market participants have kept a close eye on Sakakibara , chief of the ministry 's International Finance Bureau , as a comment he made in November after the dollar hit this year 's high of 114.92 yen pushed the currency down sharply .

1575
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
He had said then that the market 's view on Japan 's economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than the market thought .

1576
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Dealers have come to refer to 115 yen as the " Sakakibara ceiling " for the dollar following the remark .

1577
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Adding to the comments by " Mr Yen " , as Sakakibara is known for his prominence in the currency market , was BOJ governor Matsushita 's remark .

1578
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
" The recent level of the yen exchange rate has been stable , and it does not appear to be moving towards a further depreciation of the yen immediately , so import prices are likely to stabilise at current levels , " Matsushita said in an interview with the Nihon Keizai Shimbun .

1579
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
" The fact that he touched on the issue of inflation triggered by import prices shows that the BOJ does not want a further depreciation of the yen , past 115 yen , " said Yasuhito Kawashima , chief forex manager at Toyo Trust & Banking Co .

1580
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Some said the central bank may have been concerned a weaker yen would lead to unfounded pessimism about Japan 's economy .

1581
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
" There was concern that foreign investors may sell Japanese stocks if the dollar goes above 115 yen .

1582
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The BOJ does not want the yen 's weakness to lead to pessimism over the economy , " said Taisuke Tanaka , market strategist with Credit Suisse in Tokyo .

1583
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Senior BOJ officials have separately said financial markets ' views on the economy have been too negative .

1584
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
" I realise there are negative views in the markets about the impact of the consumption tax hike and drop in public spending , but the markets appear to be exaggerating the magnitude of the negative impact , " a senior BOJ official told Reuters on Friday .

1585
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
The consumption tax is due to raised in April from three to five percent .

1589
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
A Lebanese military court on Friday sentenced to death in absentia the commander of Israel 's surrogate militia in south Lebanon on treason charges .

1590
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
The court convicted General Antoine Lahd , head of the South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) , of collaborating with Israel with which Lebanon is officially at war .

1591
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Lahd , a 69-year-old former Lebanese army major-general , heads the 3,000-strong SLA militia which helps Israel hold a border zone in south Lebanon to ward off cross-frontier guerrilla raids on northern Israel .

1592
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Lahd said a few days after the trial began on February 16 that Lebanese authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the Jewish state .

1593
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
He said Israel was capable of pressuring Lebanon 's Syrian-backed government to stop the legal pursuit .

1594
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The charges against Lahd were : forming a hostile army , carrying weapons on Israel 's side , helping Israel strip off a part of Lebanese territory by violence , forming an armed gang , killing or trying to kill Lebanese civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping Lebanese citizens for long periods .

1595
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Shortly before Lahd 's trial began , a Beirut military prosecutor charged another 89 former Lebanese army soldiers with collaborating with Israel .

1596
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
No date has been set for the trial of the men , all members of the SLA living in the Israeli-held zone in south Lebanon .

1597
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Israel and Lahd have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the SLA -- a mixed Christian-Shi'ite Moslem force -- which the Jewish states regards as loyal allies .

1598
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Israel has said the Lebanese army must incorporate the SLA fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace .

1599
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
But Lebanese political analysts have said that would be out of the question and Lebanese authorities pre-empted the issue by taking legal action against Lahd .

1600
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres , calling Lahd " a great Lebanese patriot " , said earlier this year Lebanon had insulted the SLA commander by ordering his arrest on the treason charges .

1601
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Peres , who was ousted in May by rightwing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu , said there could not be real negotiations with Lebanon " unless it will stop the maltreatment of the SLA and its commanders . "

1602
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
The Beirut military court also sentenced to life in jail in absentia Etian Saqr , former head of the pro-Israeli Guardians of the Cedars , a small rightwing Christian civil war militia .

1603
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Saqr , whose trial was concurrent with Lahd 's , was convicted of " contacting the Israeli enemy , passing information to Israel and undertaking hostile acts against Lebanon " .

Fourteen years after he bludgeoned and shot a man whose trailer home he robbed in 1982 , John Mills Jr .

1663
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
, 41 , was put to death in Florida 's electric chair Friday .

1664
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
As Glenn Lawhon , a rural Florida minister who is the victim 's father , looked on , Mills was pronounced dead at 7:13 a.m. EST ( 1213 GMT ) for the murder of Lester Lawhon .

1665
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Speaking in Arabic , Mills made a final statement before an anonymous citizen flipped the switch that sent 2000 volts of electricity through his body , said Department of Corrections spokesman Eugene Morris , who was present at the execution .

1666
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
" I bear witness that there is no God but Allah and I bear witness that the prophet Mohammed is the messenger of God , " he quoted Mills as saying .

1667
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Prison officials said they had no record of Mills ' official conversion , but they said that , on May 14 , 1991 , he had asked that a new name , Yuhanna Abdullah Muhammed , be added to his prison file , which is usually an indication of a conversion to Islam .

1668
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Mills is the 38th person to die in Florida 's electric chair since the U.S. Supreme Court reversed itself in 1976 and legalised the death penalty .

1669
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Prison officials said Mills made no special request for a last meal and did not eat the steak , fried potatoes and orange juice offered him .

1670
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
He spent Thursday with family members and his spiritual adviser , Morris said .

1671
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Mills was scheduled to die Wednesday but had his sentence temporarily postponed by the Florida Supreme Court .

1673
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
In March 1982 , Mills and accomplice Michael Frederick knocked on the door of Lester Lawhon 's trailer in an attempt to rob it , police said .

1674
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Lester Lawhon was taken to a nearby airstrip where he was bludgeoned with a tire iron .

1675
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Mills then fired two shots that killed Lawhon as the victim tried to run away .

1676
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Frederick is serving a 347-year sentence .

A farmhand used the proceeds from stolen pigs to lavish tips on dancers at strip clubs and offered one $ 3,000 to pay for breast implant surgery , authorities said Friday .

1701
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
In sentencing Darrel Voeks , 38 , to a 10-year prison term on Thursday , Outagmie County Circuit Court Judge Dennis Luebke said he was " a thief by habit . "

00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
" You are self-indulgent .

1703

You are narcissitic , " Luebke said at the sentencing , adding Voeks should pay restitution of more than $ 100,000 to the farming family who had hired him .

1704
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Voeks , who was already on probation for prior pig thefts , pleaded that he was trying to pay bills for his ex-wife and children .

1705
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But the court heard that receipts showed much of the money went to dancers at strip clubs where he was known as a big tipper .

00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
He also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed .

1815
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Don Rieck , president of the National Animal Control Association , said aggressiveness in dogs was related more to gender than breed and a male dog that had not been neutered was three times more likely to bite than an unspayed female .

1816
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
The five breeds credited with the most incidents were chow chows , Rottweilers , German shepherds , cocker spaniels and Dalmatians . "

1817
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
The trends in dog bites by particular breeds have more to do with fad pets owned by individuals who need to have something unique .

1818
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Speaking strictly of dogs , 15 years ago the macho fad pet was a Doberman .

1819
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Today , Rottweilers are on the way up , " Rieck said .

1820

If approached by a stray dog , children should be taught to stand still with fists folded underneath the neck , elbows in , and gaze forward until the dog goes away .

Four African states are ready to nominate candidates for the post of U.N. secretary-general on Friday now that Boutros Boutros-Ghali has temporarily put aside his bid for re-election .

1842
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
The nominees , according to diplomats , are : Kofi Annan of Ghana , the U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping ; Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania , the former U.N. special envoy for Burundi ; Amara Essy of the Ivory Coast , its foreign minister and the U.N. General Assembly president in 1994-95 ; and Hamid Algabid of Niger , the secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference .

1843
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Representatives of the U.N. missions of Ghana , the Ivory Coast , Mauritania and Niger have scheduled a meeting with Security Council president Paolo Fulci of Italy to hand in the nominations in writing , the envoys said .

1844

It was not known if other candidates would step forward .

1845
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Diplomats said General Joseph Garba of Nigeria , a U.N. General Assembly president in 1989-90 , was putting forth his own candidacy without being nominated by his country .

1846
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday opened the door for other Africans to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race .

1847
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
His supporters said this meant he remained a candidate in case the race reached an impasse .

1848
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
The United States on Nov. 19 vetoed his bid for re-election while the other 14 Security Council members supported him .

1849
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
The move by the African states means that the council could begin voting on candidates next week , a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee .

1850
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
The Security Council has to vote on a new secretary-general and then seek the endorsement of the 185-members General Assembly before December 31 when Boutros-Ghali 's term expires .

1860
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000

Fini told state radio RAI he met Mussolini thanks to the good offices of Giuseppe Tatarella , AN 's leader in the Chamber of Deputies ( lower house ) , and had overcome their differences .

1863
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Mussolini , 33 , resigned from the parliamentary party group for what she said were strictly political reasons .

1864

The fiery politician , who is also a niece of screen star Sophia Loren , had accused AN leaders of stifling internal party debate .

1865
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Mussolini , who sits in the Chamber , told La Stampa newspaper last month after quitting AN 's parliamentary party that she was considering joining the neo-fascist Social Movement ( MS-Fiamma ) formed by some of the Duce 's World War Two followers .

The European Union and Poland have resolved disagreements over a new Polish oil import regime , the European Commission said on Friday .

1878
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
The EU had objected to increases in Polish tariffs on imports of gasoline and gasoil products introduced on January 1 , 1996 , saying they contravened levels envisaged in the so-called Europe Agreement between the EU and Poland .

1879
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
The increases were aimed at protecting the Polish market while helping to modernise the local oil industry .

1880
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
" The EU and Poland have now reached a final settlement regarding issues related to the Polish import regime in the oils sector , " the Commission said in a statement .

1881
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Under the agreement , Poland will abolish all oil import tariffs by 2001 , remove all oil price controls and end quantitative restrictions on imports by January 1 , 1997 .

1882
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000

Hindu nationalists forced adjournment of India 's lower house of parliament on Friday , in protest against a proposal to observe a minute 's silence over the destruction of a mosque by a Hindu mob in 1992 .

1887
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Members of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) shouted pro-Hindu slogans in the house after a communist deputy made the proposal in remembrance of the Babri mosque , which was razed on December 6 , 1992 .

1888
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000

1890
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
The destruction of the 16th-century mosque in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya triggered nationwide Hindu-Moslem violence in which more than 3,000 people were killed .

The BJP backs a hardline Hindu campaign to build a temple at the site of the mosque , which Hindus believe was the birthplace of the Lord Rama .

1893

Relations between Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Prime Minister John Major are good despite media reports of a rift over European policy , a spokesman for Major 's office said on Friday .

1946
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Asked about the reports , the spokesman said : " Relations are good . "

1947
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Asked about Major 's mood after a day of media speculation about his political fortunes , the spokesman said : " He is resolute .

1948
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
He is getting on with the job . "

1949
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
The spokesman said he was not aware of any meetings overnight between Clarke and Major , nor of any talks between the prime minister and parliamentary business managers .

STEPHENVILLE , Newfoundland 1996-12-06

1953
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Two people were killed when an executive jet en route to Ireland from Michigan crashed on approach to an airport in Stephenville , Newfoundland , on Friday , authorities said .

1954
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
The pilot and co-pilot , the only two aboard , were killed in the crash of the Learjet 36 , airport manager David Snow said in a telephone interview .

1955
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Snow said the plane last reported to air traffic control at about 3 A.M. local time / 1:30 A.M. EST ( 0630 GMT ) when it began its final approach about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from the airport in this east coast Canadian province .

1956
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
That was the last communication the aircraft made with the airport , he added .

1957
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
" We considered it as being missing until about 0600 ( 4:30 A.M. EST ) ( 0930 GMT ) .

1958
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
That 's when the wreckage was discovered , " Snow said .

1959
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
He said the cargo flight originated in Grand Rapids , Michigan , and was due to stop at Stephenville for refueling before going to Shannon , Ireland .

1960
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
The cause of the crash was not yet known .

1961

JERUSALEM 1996-12-06

1964
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
PLO negotiators said on Friday Palestinian President Yasser Arafat , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak might all meet on Saturday to try to clinch a deal on Israel 's handover of Hebron to the PLO .

1965
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
" It is very possible that Arafat and Netanyahu will meet in Cairo on Saturday .

1966
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
There is work on arranging such a meeting hosted by President Mubarak , " one PLO official , who requested anonymity , told Reuters .

1967
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Israeli officials said no meeting had yet been set .

1968
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Arafat 's adviser Nabil Abu Rdainah said :

1969
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
" President Arafat is ready to meet Prime Minister Netanyahu but no time or date has been set for such a meeting yet .

1970
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
" President Arafat 's position is clear that such a meeting should come after successful negotiations so that the meeting would have positive results .

1971
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Especially since the Hebron issue has not been agreed yet and the crucial disputed issues have not been resolved . "

1972
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
But Rdainah said Arafat would go to Cairo on Saturday for talks with Mubarak .

1973
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Both Arafat and Netanyahu have expressed willingness to meet .

1974
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
They last met in Washington after clashes in September that killed 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis .

1975
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
The violence was spurred by Israel 's opening an entrance to a tunnel near Moslem sites in Jerusalem .

1976
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
The Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) negotiators said the last two weeks of talks with Israel on implementing the long-delayed handover of most of Hebron to PLO rule had been " meaningless " , necessitating an Arafat-Netanyahu meeting .

1977
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Mubarak 's adviser Osama el-Baz said on Thursday there were efforts to arrange a meeting between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders .

1978
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Palestinian Authority Secretary General Ahmed Abdel-Rahman said on Thursday he understood it could be held in Cairo either on Friday or Sunday .

1979
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Abdel-Rahman had said on Thursday he did not think Saturday would be the date because it is the Jewish sabbath .

1980
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
But the Jewish sabbath ends at sundown , so a night meeting would not interfere with the religious observance .

1983
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Turkey 's efforts to prevent Kurdish rebels and smugglers infiltrating from Syria are being badly hindered because the military does not have a map of its own minefields on the border , a commission of parliamentarians said .

1984
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
" It is not known exactly where the mines have been sown because a minefield chart cannot be found , " the commission said in a report on border protection .

1985
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
The report , to be debated in parliament in coming weeks , was seen by Reuters on Friday . "

1986
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Officials say the minefields present an obstacle to the security forces , " it said .

1987
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It said Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) guerrillas sometimes know the layout of mined areas along the border better than the security forces .

1988
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
" Terrorists and smugglers have dug up the mines , defused them and opened up wide paths in some areas .

1989
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
They can come in and out easily as the minefields are not an obstacle , " it said .

1990
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
An armed forces spokesman was not available for comment .

1991

Three people were killed on Friday in a gun battle between rival groups of anti-guerrilla militiamen on the streets of this southeastern Turkish city , police said .

1998
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Four others were wounded in the clash , caused by a blood feud between two families , the Kesers and Karabuluts , serving as state-paid village guards against Kurdish rebels .

1999
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Police said the guards fired automatic weapons at each other .

2000

One of the dead was a civilian passer-by .

2001
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
The role of the 70,000 mainly Kurdish village guards who fight Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) guerrillas in the southeast has been questioned recently after media allegations that many of them are involved in common crime .

WASHINGTON 1996-12-05

2052
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
The United States Thursday blasted the release from a Greek prison of a Palestinian guerrilla convicted of bombing an airliner and killing a teenager in 1982 , saying the move " does not make sense . "

2053
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
" All of us who have been victimised by terrorists ... need to stand together against terrorists .

2054
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
We ca n't let terrorists out of jail when they are a danger to civilians all around the world , " State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said . '

2055
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Mohammed Rashid " is a terrorist who deserves to be behind bars .

2056
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It is inexplicable to us why he would have been allowed to leave Greece before serving his just sentence ... This is an incomprehensible move .

2057
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It does not make sense , " Burns told a news briefing .

2058
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
He spoke after Rashid left Greece Thursday on being freed from prison early for good behaviour after serving 8-1/2 years .

2059
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
The Clinton administration 's strong views on this subject have been conveyed to the Greek government , Burns said .

2060
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Mahammad Rashid was whisked from Korydallos maximum security prison just outside Athens to the airport where he boarded a regular Olympic Airways flight to Cairo where he would transit to Tunis and the former Palestine Liberation Organisation headquarters .

2061
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Rashid , 46 , was sentenced to 18 years in prison by a Greek court in 1992 after being convicted of premeditated murder in the mid-air bombing of a Pan American airliner in 1982 .

2062
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
His sentence had been reduced to 15 years in 1993 .

2063
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
A parole court ruled recently that Rashid could be freed after serving 8-1/2 years , with time in pre-trial detention counted towards his term , but said he must be expelled immediately from Greece .

2064
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
The United States accuses Rashid of belonging to the May 15 Palestinian guerrilla group and being an accomplished student of master Palestinian bombmaker Abu Ibrahim .

2065
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Three FBI agents who testified against Rashid during the trial , held at Korydallos prison , said they had ample evidence against Rashid for a bomb planted on a Pan American plane in Brazil in 1982 and a mid-air bomb blast on a TWA airliner approaching Athens in 1986 which killed four U.S. citizens .

After four days of diplomatic wrangling over procedures , some 600 delegates from nations small and large got down to the nitty-gritty of setting the digital agenda for the first time .

2079
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Cyberspace squabbles overshadowed the debate on a stack of proposals covering literary and artistic works , the rights of performers and producers of music and producers of databases .

2080
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
" If it goes on like this , we wo n't have enough time to finish all the discussions , " a frustrated Western delegate said . "

2081
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
They announced they will start evening sessions next week . "

2082
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Attempts by copyright-based industries to ensure they get a cut from online works led to a storm of protests by Internet companies and critics who say the pacts would curb public access to online information from soccer results to stock prices .

2083
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
" It 's not illegal to make photocopies of newspaper articles .

2084
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It 's fair use .

2085
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
We can read sports statistics or stock prices .

2086
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But with the treaty , this kind of fact will be owned and subject to licensing , " said James Love , a consumer lobbyist heading the Washington-based Consumer Project on Technology .

2087
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
" None of the treaties are ready to move .

2088
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
These people do n't understand what they 're doing . "

2089
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
At stake are billions of dollars and the future of the electronic information industry -- the coming medium for the distribution of music , films , literature , software and commerce .

2090
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Supporters of the three pacts say they are only an extension of existing intellectual property rights , covered by the century-old Berne Convention .

2091
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But an array of opponents from the network industry to consumer , scientific and academic groups say the pacts will give sweeping powers to entertainment and copyright-based industries .

2092
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
A quick survey at the conference centre found few officials who had actually surfed the Internet .

2093
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Mongolia 's state copyright official , Gundegma Jargalshaihan , said apologetically that he had just arrived from Ulan Bator and was not aware of the details of the digital agenda .

2094
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
" We do n't have money for Internet in Mongolia , " he added .

2095
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Alexander Bavykin , deputy legal chief at Russia 's foreign ministry , said Moscow had yet to formulate a policy on copyright in cybersppace .

2096
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
He too had never browsed the Net .

2097
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
" I 've never tried it and why should I ?

2098
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
There are lots of other things in this life I have n't tried either , " he said .

2099
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
A visit to the computer centre offering Internet services found a lone European official clicking away on his mouse .

2100
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
" Internet is a potential cash cow for copyright-based industries and we need roadmaps on the information superhighway , " said Marc Pearl , vice-president of the Information Technology Association of America , a trade association of U.S. network companies opposing the treaties .

2101
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
" But there are a lot of dinosaurs here .

2102
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
People here do n't understand Internet technology .

2103
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Because they do n't understand technology , they fear the unknown . "

2104
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Before the Internet , those whose business was to protect copyrights knew where they stood .

2105
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Their enemies were tangible if elusive , such as the people who pirated music cassettes .

2106
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But the Internet , a global computer network where anything from music to software can be duplicated and distributed at the click of a computer mouse , has ripped up the rulebooks .

2107
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Network operators said the draft laws would hold them responsible for copyright infringements in the system and expose them to multi-billion-dollar liabilities .

2108
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
" There are 500 million messages transmitted through the Internet everyday , " said Tim Casey of the U.S.-based MCI Communications Corporation . "

Italy said on Friday it had evacuated 17 Roman Catholic nuns and priests from Zaire where they had been at risk from fighting between government troops and ethnic Tutsi rebels .

2113
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
The Foreign Ministry said the 10 Europeans and seven Africans took a special flight from the Garamba national park in northern Zaire to the Ugandan capital Kampala where they were being looked after at the Italian embassy .

2114
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The group had travelled from their mission on the edge of the park to a landing strip to make the rendezvous , a ministry official said .

2115
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
The ministry said the group consisted of 13 nuns , seven Italians and six Zaireans , and four priests , two from Belgium , one from Spain and one from Zambia .

2119
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Benchaou died of his injuries on Thursday night , two days after the blast .

2120
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
A newly-married Canadian woman and a man from New Caledonia died instantly in the bomb that injured 90 others in the rush-hour train .

2121
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
An embassy spokesman said Benchaou , the son of a Moroccan army colonel , had been due to take his doctorate in March and hoped to become a teacher .

2122
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Investigators have said the explosion bore the hallmarks of Algerian Moslem fundamentalists who staged a series of bombings last year which killed eight people and injured more than 160 .

MANTUA , Italy 1996-12-06

2125
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro visited the symbolic heartland of the separatist Northern League on Friday and appealed to its supporters to drop their campaign for a breakaway state .

2126
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Addressing a convention on Italian unity in Mantua , where the party has set up its own " parliament of the north " , Scalfaro made a direct appeal to what he called " my friends from the League " to work instead for federal reform .

2127
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
" It is an invitation , a commitment , a promise .

2128
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Let 's march together , " Scalfaro , a northerner himself , said .

2129
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
" Help Italy to teach , to propose a capacity for strong local autonomy , for the federalism which can give new vigour to our blood .

2130
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
But turn back from the line you are taking now , " he said .

2131
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Scalfaro was in Mantua to attend a ceremony commemorating the executions there by Austrian rulers in 1852 and 1853 of a group of Italians who had campaigned for national unity .

2132
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
He was jeered and whistled at by a small group of League supporters when he arrived for a visit marked by heavy security .

2133
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Witnesses said the protesters were outnumbered by other Italians who waved tricolour flags in the national red , white and green or shouted " Viva Italia " .

2134
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
The League won more than eight percent of votes at the last general election in April on a federalist platform but its leader Umberto Bossi later switched to a separatist agenda .

2135
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000

00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
A " Euro-sceptic " member of the ruling Conservative party said on Thursday British finance minister Kenneth Clarke had to resign to prevent the party disintegrating over the issue of a single European currency .

2199
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Member of Parliament Tony Marlow said the resignation of the chancellor of the exchequer was the only way to make the Conservatives electable in a general election which must take place by May next year .

2200
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
" We have a divided and split Cabinet .

2205
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Marlow 's comment come on the heels of speculation that Clarke had threatened to resign if the government changed its " wait and see " policy on a single currency and declared it would not sign up for the currency in the next Parliament .

2206
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Clarke denied on Thursday he had threatened to resign and said his position on the single currency was in tune with that of Prime Minister John Major .

Major told parliament on Thursday he would keep his options open on single-currency membership .

2212
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The Australian opposition on Friday demanded a high-powered investigation into paedophilia in the Australian diplomatic service after the federal court forced the head of the existing inquiry to stand aside .

2213
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
The court said inquiry head Chris Hunt might be biased , since he privately told a newspaper he had turned up no major evidence of paedophile activity , even though he still had months ' of investigation before him .

2214
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
" Today we are left with a ruinous wreck beyond salvage and a continuing pall of doubt and suspicion hanging over our diplomatic service , " opposition foreign affairs spokesman Laurie Brereton said .

2215
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
But the government responded by pressing ahead with the original inquiry , established in May , appointing a new head to lead it .

2216
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Critics say that if there were many paedophiles in senior posts in the Foreign Affairs Department then a secret inquiry would be open to internal influence and would become a public service whitewash .

2217
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Accordingly , they demand an open investigation .

2218
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
A spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said the appointment of a new inquiry head , administrative law expert Pamela O'Neil , showed the government 's commitment to pursue the matter .

Paul Crofts , 33 , and an accomplice were contracted to shoot a man , identified only as Tony , in the leg to punish him for his misconduct with a female friend of the contractor , the New South Wales Supreme Court was told .

2227

But in February 1993 Leszic Betcher , was shot and killed after answering a knock at the door of his Sydney home . "

2228
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
The inference from all the material is that the marauders had come to the wrong house , " Judge Michael Grove said .

2229
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
In sentencing Crofts , who pleaded guilty , Grove took into account his " mildly retarded " intellectual state , which placed him in the lowest two percent of the population .

2230
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Grove said Betcher was " not only the victim of a horrendous crime , but his death was brought about in circumstances of an equally ghastly error on the part of the prisoner and his accomplices " .

2231
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000

When asked about the outlook for the fiscal year beginning in April , Nukaya said the economy may slow down in the early part of the fiscal year due to a planned consumption tax hike , but that would be only temporary .

Canada 's Bre-X Minerals Ltd and Barrick Gold Corp are to continue negotiations to hammer out a partnership agreement to develop the spectacular Busang gold find in Indonesia , sources close to the talks said on Friday .

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
" The negotiations will be held both in Toronto and in Jakarta , " one source , speaking on condition of anonymity , told Reuters .

2320
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Another source said most of the key negotiators from both Bre-X and Barrick had returned to Toronto , but declined to say if there had been any progress in their negotiations .

2321
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Both sources said Bre-X and Barrick did not hold talks on Thursday with Mines and Energy Ministry Secretary-General Umar Said , who is coordinating the negotiations over the Busang find in East Kalimantan .

2322
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
The first source also said Bre-X had until December 21 to submit to the Indonesian Mines and Energy Ministry a feasibility study on the central region of the Busang property , estimated to contain 2.6 million ounces of gold .

2323
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
The richest parts of the property to the north and south of the central region have been estimated by Bre-X to contain 57 million ounces of gold .

2324
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
" Bre-X is expected to complete the feasibility report by December 16 and submit it to the government before the December 21 deadline , " the source said .

2325
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
He said Bre-X would then formally seek the permission of the Indonesian government to begin construction to develop Busang 's central region , which might take up to two years .

2326
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
The source declined to say if there had been any progress in the talks between Bre-X and Barrick .

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
" While there has been some agreement in principle on some issues , there are still others such as procedures and mechanisms that needed to be sorted out , " he added .

2330
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
The source said no new deadline had been set by the Mines and Energy Ministry for Bre-X and Barrick to strike a deal .

2331
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
The Ministry had given the companies until December 4 to complete a partnership deal , and advised Bre-X to take a 25 percent stake and Barrick 75 percent to develop the property .

2332
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
" As far as I am aware , there 's been no new deadline , " the source said .

2333

The Ministry 's Umar said on Thursday that both Bre-X and Barrick had responded positively to a government letter recommending a 25-75 split in the Busang gold property .

2334
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
The government also wants 10 percent of the property .

2335
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Umar said the government had yet to receive a formal reply from the companies .

2336
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
He had said earlier that if the two companies failed to reach a partnership agreement , the government would explore other ways to expedite development of the Busang find .

2337
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Bre-X has a partnership deal with PT Panutan Duta of the Panutan Group run by President Suharto 's eldest son , Sigit Harjojudanto , under which Panutan would receive $ 40 million over 40 months plus a 10 percent stake Busang 's richest parts .

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
A version with lower road clearance and front and rear spoilers accounted for two-thirds of the sales .

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

2347
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Singapore 's winning campaign to host the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) 's first ministerial meeting reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade , the lifeblood of its economy , analysts said .

2348
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
" As one of the world 's most externally oriented economies , Singapore has a disproportionately large stake in the WTO , " said Desmond Supple , economist at research house I.D.E.A .

2349
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
" Singapore stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is the engine of its growth , accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product . "

2350
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
The city-state met U.S. opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting , expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13 .

2351
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
In a stand some analysts linked to controversy over Singapore 's caning of an American teenager for vandalism , then-U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor had said the meeting ought to be held where the WTO was going to be headquartered .

2352
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
That would have meant Geneva .

2353
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
But Singapore had the support of other WTO members .

2354
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Derek da Cunha , senior fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies ( ISEAS ) , said Singapore 's hosting of the conference " carries a great deal of symbolism for the city-state , underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across the globe . "

2355
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
There is the international prestige Singapore would enjoy , but " more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market " , said Tan Kong Yam , head of Business Policy at the National University of Singapore .

2356
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
At the ministerial meeting , trade ministers will review the work of the WTO and the implementation of the Uruguay Round free trade commitments under its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) .

2357
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
In June , the WTO hailed Singapore for its open market policies but the European Union and other trading powers called on Singapore to speed up the opening of its services sector .

2358
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Supple said the struggle that Singapore had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks .

2359
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
" There is tension at every step of the way , " since a battle line between the West and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights , he said .

2360
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Supple said hosting the meeting carried prestige for Singapore , " however , this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region . "

2361
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
From a commercial point of view , the meeting would be good for Singapore 's tourism industry , Tan said .

2362
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
A large part of Singapore 's workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average Singaporean " would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues , " Tan said .

2363
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
" But the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for Singapore as a small economy . "

2364
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Supple said any political gains the Singapore government would get from the WTO meeting -- ahead of a general election due by April 1997 -- would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda .

2365
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
" If there are any movements toward freer trade , then Singapore 's economy and the electorate would gain , " he said . "

2366
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But I do n't think it would be wise to play up the political aspect of this .

2367
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I think political issues will take secondary importance to all these economic issues that will be displayed . "

TOKYO 1996-12-06

2370
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp ( NTT ) said on Friday that it hopes to move into the international telecommunications business as soon as possible following the government 's decision to split NTT into three firms under a holding company .

2371
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
" We hope to start international telephone business as soon as possible , " a company official told Reuters .

2372
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
The official said the latest government decision to split the company under a holding company would allow flexibility in NTT 's international phone business .

2373
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Earlier , Posts and Telecommunications Minister Hisao Horinouchi told a news conference the government plans to split NTT into three firms under a holding company , but did not specify when the restructuring would likely take effect .

2374
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
One of the three new companies will be a long-distance operator and the other two will be local-call operators , Horinouchi said .

2375
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
One of the local firms will operate in west Japan and the other in east Japan , he added .

2376
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
The long-distance operator will offer international services , Horinouchi said .

2377
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
The NTT official said the timing of the planned split-up was uncertain because more discussions by government officials were required .

2380

The discount price format store BILO is to complement Ahold 's full service supermarket TOPS , recently launched in Asia .

2383
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
" In the coming five to ten years , Ahold plans to open many more stores of both formats , making TOPS and BILO household names in the region , " Ahold said in a statement .

2384
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
As well as its activities in Asia , Dutch retail group Ahold has a strong presence in Europe , in the U.S. and the company recently announced a joint venture agreement in Brazil .

2640
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
South Africa 's trip to Kanpur for the third test against India has given former England test cricketer Bob Woolmer the chance of a sentimental return to his birthplace .

2641
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Woolmer was born in the northern city of Kanpur when his father worked there for an insurance compnay and was himself an active cricketer .

2642
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
" It 's been a sentimental journey ...

2643
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
A visit to India is always an intriguing experience , " Woolmer , now the South African coach , said on Saturday .

2644
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Woolmer , 48 , played 19 tests for England between 1975 and 1981 .

2645
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
His first cricketing sojurn to India was as a member of Tony Greig 's England side in 1976-77 .

2646
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
His father Clarence Woolmer represented United Province , now renamed Uttar Pradesh , in India 's Ranji Trophy national championship and captained the state during 1949 .

2647
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Now aged 86 , Woolmer senior lives with his son in Cape Town .

2648
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Woolmer 's memories of Kanpur are few and blurred .

2649
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
" I do n't remember much of the place , " he said . "

2650
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I came here on zero and left at three ( aged three ) when my father was transferred to Calcutta where I spent another four and half years .

2651
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
" But I do remember we had a cobra snake in the basement of our house .

2652
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Also that my father bought a bicycle and when we rode over a hose pipe it broke into two . "

2653
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Woolmer said the hospital where he was born is close to the stadium where the India-South Africa test will be played .

WHISTLER , British Columbia 1996-12-06

2766
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
World Cup ski officials hope to be able to get in at least one men 's downhill training run on Saturday in an effort to salvage the weekend racing programme .

2767
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
For the third consecutive day , Friday 's scheduled training runs were cancelled due to heavy wet snow and fog on Whistler Mountain , leaving the scheduled World Cup events in jeopardy .

2768
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Rules call for at least one training run to be completed before a World Cup downhill race can be staged .

2769
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Organisers hope to get that run in on Saturday morning , conditions permitting , and stage the race later in the day or on Sunday .

2770
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
" There was no possibility today to make a training run , " said Bernd Zobel , the Canadian men 's national coach , citing too much new snow and poor visibility .

2771
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
If organisers are forced to run the downhill on Sunday , the super-giant slalom originally scheduled for Sunday would likely be abandoned .

LONDON 1996-12-07

2857
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
David Campese will consider offers to play club rugby in England but looks more likely to spend the next year chasing business opportunities in Australia .

2858
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
The 34-year-old winger played his final game in a Wallaby jersey on Saturday but is currently a target for clubs eager to match London side Saracens who have already snapped up Francois Pienaar , Michael Lynagh and Philippe Sella .

2859
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
" If the opportunity is there I 'd obviously think about it but the thing that holds me back is business , " said Campese .

00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
" I 'd like to come over but there are a lot of things happening at home .

2861

I 've also got a contract to play for New South Wales in the Super 12 next year . "

2862
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Former Wallaby captain Nick Farr-Jones believes Campese may yet be tempted to England .

2863
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
" I 'm sure there are a few people in England who 'd be delighted to have David Campese in their club 's jersey , " he said .

Australia bade farewell to David Campese in spectacular fashion by overwhelming the Barbarians 39-12 in the final match of their European tour at Twickenham on Saturday .

3126
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
The Wallabies ran in five tries with Campese , who has retired from test rugby after collecting 101 caps and a world record 64 tries , adding one last touchdown in a Wallaby jersey before departing the international game .

3127
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
The Barbarians included 14 internationals but , with only two pre-match practice sessions behind them , proved no real match for a Wallaby side determined to finish their 12-match tour unbeaten .

3128
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
The touring team were 27-0 ahead by half-time before easing up in the second-half .

3129
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Full-back Matthew Burke finished with a personal haul of 24 points to take his tour aggregate to 136 .

TIRANA 1996-12-07

3162
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Albanian coach Astrit Hafizi said on Saturday it was important that his players brush aside the country 's short ban by FIFA in order to concentrate on next Saturday'sWorld Cup group nine qualifier against Northern Ireland .

3163
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
World soccer 's governing body reinstated Albania last Tuesday after the Balkan country 's government lifted suspensions on various soccer officials .

3164
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
FIFA had banned Albania indefinitely after its sports ministry had ordered the suspension of Albanian Football Association general secretary Eduard Dervishi and dissolved the executive committee .

3165
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
" We would be very happy with a draw in Belfast , " said Hafizi . "

3166
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Especially if one takes into consideration our difficult post-suspension situation and the fact Northern Ireland is very keen to win . "

3167
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Regular defender Artur Lekbello , who is injured , was missing from Hafizi 's squad named on Saturday for the Belfast match .

3177
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Jones became the fourth century-maker of the match , equalling the feats of Tasmanian trio David Boon , Shaun Young and Michael DiVenuto .

3178
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Jones , who took over as captain for the match in the absence of Australia test leg-spinner Shane Warne , added 195 runs for the third wicket with left-hander Laurie Harper .

3179
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Harper was eventually dismissed for 77 after the pair joined forces with their side reeling on nine for two .

3180

3189
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
South Korea made virtually certain of an Asian Cup quarter-final spot with a 4-2 win over Indonesia in a Group A match on Saturday .

3190
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
After going four up in the first 55 minutes South Korea allowed Indonesia , newcomers to Asian Cup finals , back into the match , conceding two goals from rare counter attacks .

3191
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Kim Do Hoon opened the scoring for South Korea in only the fifth minute , turning unmarked on the penalty spot to fire a shot into the top corner .

3192
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
It looked like turning into a rout as Hwang Sun Hong rapidly added two more in the seventh and 15th minutes but although the Koreans continued to dominate they failed to add to the score before the interval .

3193
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
But they started the second half where they had left off and it was not long before they went four up , Ko Jeong Woon heading in from a free kick in the 55th minute .

3194
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
The Koreans then appeared to relax , allowing the Indonesians to get back into the match .

3195
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Ronny Wabia scored for Indonesia three minutes later direct from a a corner kick that Korean goalkeeper Kim Byung reached with one hand but failed to keep out .

3196
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
With 65 minutes gone Indonesia 's Widodo Putra , who scored a spectacular goal against Kuwait on Wednesday , was again on target , breaking through the Korean defence to beat the keeper with a low shot .

3197
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Indonesian keeper Hendro Kartiko produced a string of fine saves to prevent the Koreans increasing their lead .

3383
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Vancouver Canucks star right wing Pavel Bure was suspended for one game by the National Hockey League and fined $ 1,000 Friday for his hit on Buffalo Sabres defenceman Garry Galley on Wednesday .

3384
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Bure received a double-minor penalty for high-sticking with 2:22 left in the first period of Wednesday 's 7-6 overtime win by Vancouver after colliding with Galley in Buffalo zone .

3385
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Galley suffered a concussion and did not return to the game .

3386
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
" Mr Bure left his feet to deliver a forearm blow to Mr Galley as he was about to be checked legally by his opponent , " said NHL discipline chief Brian Burke in handing out the suspension .

3387
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
" Although it is clear from the videotape that Mr Bure 's actions were a reaction to the impending hit and there was no intent to injure his opponent , there can be no excuse for this type of conduct , " Burke said .

3388
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Bure , who is struggling with only nine goals and 12 assists in 26 games , will miss Saturday 's home game against Ottawa .
