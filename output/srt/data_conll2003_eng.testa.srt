CRICKET - LEICESTERSHIRE TAKE OVER AT TOP AFTER INNINGS VICTORY .

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
LONDON 1996-08-30

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
West Indian all-rounder Phil Simmons took four for 38 on Friday as Leicestershire beat Somerset by an innings and 39 runs in two days to take over at the head of the county championship .

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Their stay on top , though , may be short-lived as title rivals Essex , Derbyshire and Surrey all closed in on victory while Kent made up for lost time in their rain-affected match against Nottinghamshire .

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
After bowling Somerset out for 83 on the opening morning at Grace Road , Leicestershire extended their first innings by 94 runs before being bowled out for 296 with England discard Andy Caddick taking three for 83 .

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Trailing by 213 , Somerset got a solid start to their second innings before Simmons stepped in to bundle them out for 174 .

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Essex , however , look certain to regain their top spot after Nasser Hussain and Peter Such gave them a firm grip on their match against Yorkshire at Headingley .

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hussain , considered surplus to England 's one-day requirements , struck 158 , his first championship century of the season , as Essex reached 372 and took a first innings lead of 82 .

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
By the close Yorkshire had turned that into a 37-run advantage but off-spinner Such had scuttled their hopes , taking four for 24 in 48 balls and leaving them hanging on 119 for five and praying for rain .

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
At the Oval , Surrey captain Chris Lewis , another man dumped by England , continued to silence his critics as he followed his four for 45 on Thursday with 80 not out on Friday in the match against Warwickshire .

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
He was well backed by England hopeful Mark Butcher who made 70 as Surrey closed on 429 for seven , a lead of 234 .

12
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Derbyshire kept up the hunt for their first championship title since 1936 by reducing Worcestershire to 133 for five in their second innings , still 100 runs away from avoiding an innings defeat .

13
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Australian Tom Moody took six for 82 but Chris Adams , 123 , and Tim O'Gorman , 109 , took Derbyshire to 471 and a first innings lead of 233 .

14
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
After the frustration of seeing the opening day of their match badly affected by the weather , Kent stepped up a gear to dismiss Nottinghamshire for 214 .

15
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They were held up by a gritty 84 from Paul Johnson but ex-England fast bowler Martin McCague took four for 55 .

16
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
By stumps Kent had reached 108 for three .

SOCCER - SHEARER NAMED AS ENGLAND CAPTAIN .

78
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
LONDON 1996-08-30

79
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The world 's costliest footballer Alan Shearer was named as the new England captain on Friday .

80
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The 26-year-old , who joined Newcastle for 15 million pounds sterling ( $ 23.4 million ) , takes over from Tony Adams , who led the side during the European championship in June , and former captain David Platt .

81
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Adams and Platt are both injured and will miss England 's opening World Cup qualifier against Moldova on Sunday .

82
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Shearer takes the captaincy on a trial basis , but new coach Glenn Hoddle said he saw no reason why the former Blackburn and Southampton skipper should not make the post his own .

83
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
" I 'm sure there wo n't be a problem , I 'm sure Alan is the man for the job , " Hoddle said .

84
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
" There were three or four people who could have done it but when I spoke to Alan he was up for it and really wanted it .

85
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
" In four days it 's very difficult to come to a 100 percent conclusion about something like this ...

86
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
but he knows how to conduct himself , his team mates respect him and he knows about the team situation even though he plays up front . "

87
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Shearer 's Euro 96 striking partner Teddy Sheringham withdrew from the squad with an injury on Friday .

88
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He will probably be replaced by Shearer 's Newcastle team mate Les Ferdinand .

104
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Rotor Volgograd must play their next home game behind closed doors after fans hurled bottles and stones at Dynamo Moscow players during a 1-0 home defeat on Saturday that ended Rotor 's brief spell as league leaders .

105
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The head of the Russian league 's disciplinary committee , Anatoly Gorokhovsky , said on Friday that Rotor would play Lada Togliatti to empty stands on September 3 .

106
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The club , who put Manchester United out of last year 's UEFA Cup , were fined $ 1,000 .

107
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Despite the defeat , Rotor are well placed with 11 games to play in the championship .

108
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Lying three points behind Alania and two behind Dynamo Moscow , the Volgograd side have a game in hand over the leaders and two over the Moscow club .

110

PANAMA CITY 1996-08-30

111
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Panamanian boxing legend Roberto " Hands of Stone " Duran climbs into the ring on Saturday in another age-defying attempt to sustain his long career .

112
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Duran , 45 , takes on little-known Mexican Ariel Cruz , 30 , in a super middleweight non-title bout in Panama City .

113
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The fight , Duran 's first on home soil for 10 years , is being billed here as the " Return of the Legend " and Duran still talks as if he was in his prime .

114
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
" I want a fifth title .

115
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This match is to prepare me .

116
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I feel good .

117
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I 'm not retiring , " Duran told Reuters .

118
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But those close to the boxer acknowledge that the man who has won championships in four different weight classes -- lightweight , welterweight , junior middleweight and middleweight -- is drawing close to the end of his career .

119
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
" Each time he fights , he 's on the last frontier of his career .

120
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If he loses Saturday , it could devalue his position as one of the world 's great boxers , " Panamanian Boxing Association President Ramon Manzanares said .

121
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Duran , whose 97-12 record spans three decades , hopes a win in the 10-round bout will earn him a rematch against Puerto Rico 's Hector " Macho " Camacho .

122
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Camacho took a controversial points decision against the Panamanian in Atlantic City in June in a title fight .

NEW YORK 1996-08-30

282
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Andre Agassi escaped disaster on Thursday but Wimbledon finalist MaliVai Washington and Marcelo Rios were not so fortunate on a night of upsets at the U.S. Open .

283
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The 11th-seeded Washington fell short of reprising his Wimbledon miracle comeback as he lost to red-hot wildcard Alex O'Brien 6-3 6-4 5-7 3-6 6-3 in a two hour 51 minute struggle on the Stadium court .

284
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Next door on the grandstand , 10th seed Rios lost to another player with a Wimbledon connection -- bad boy Jeff Tarango .

285
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The temperamental left-hander defeated the Chilean 6-4 4-6 7-6 6-2 .

286
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The day programme went smoothly although sixth-seeded former champion Agassi had to wriggle out of a dangerous 3-6 0-4 hole , winning 18 of the last 19 games against India 's Leander Paes .

287
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But the night belonged to the upstarts .

288
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Washington , who climbed back from a 1-5 deficit , two sets down in the third set against Todd Martin in the Wimbledon semifinals , looked poised for another sensational comeback .

289
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
O'Brien , a winner two weeks ago in New Haven for his first pro title , served for the match at 5-4 in the third set before Washington came charging back .

290
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
" I just kept saying to myself , ' keep giving yourself the best chance to win , keep battling , maybe something will happen , ' " said the 26-year-old O'Brien , ranked 65th .

291
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
" I kept my composure and I was proud of myself for that -- usually I would have folded up the tent and gone home . "

292
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The hard-serving O'Brien , a former U.S. collegiate national champion , fired up 17 aces to ultimately subdue the never-say-die Washington .

293
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The fifth set stayed on serve until the sixth game , when Washington , after saving one break point with a forehand winner down the line , netted a backhand to give O'Brien a 4-2 lead .

294
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The Texan blasted in two aces to hold serve at 5-2 and then converted his eighth match point for victory when Washington found the net with another backhand from 40-0 .

295
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
" You just kind of keep fighting and you keep trying to make him play a little bit .

296
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think he got a little tight at a couple of moments , " said Washington . "

297
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But I think he served pretty well when he had to . "

298
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Tarango , whose Wimbledon tantrum two years ago brought him a $ 28,000 fine and suspension from this year 's tournament at the All-England Club , argued calls and taunted fans in his lively two hour , 24 minute tango with Rios on the grandstand .

299
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
A boisterous cheering section backed the distracted Chilean and booed the lanky American , who ate up all the attention .

300
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
" I 'm an emotional player , " said the 104th-ranked Tarango . "

301
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I think I played very well tonight , very focused . "

302
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The match turned on the third-set tiebreaker , which the American won 7-5 much to the dismay of the spectators .

303
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
" I love the crowd if they boo me every day .

304
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It fires me up , makes me play my best tennis , " Tarango said .

305
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
" I played some of my best tennis in college when fraternities were throwing beer on me .

306
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If tennis was like that every day , I think everybody wold be having a lot more fun . "

307
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Rios did not appreciate Tarango 's antics .

308
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
" He 's always complaining too much , " said Rios . "

309
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But I think it 's not that .

310
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I think I played really bad .

311
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It was tough to play at night .

312
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Balls were going really fast .

313
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I lost too many points that I never lose .

314
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I did n't play my tennis . "

315
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
" I do n't see the ball like I see during the day .

316
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I play an American so that 's why I play at night .

317
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I did n't feel good on the court . "

318
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
At the end of the match , Tarango blew sarcastic kisses to the crowd , then jiggled his body to a Rios rooting section in a jeering salute .

319
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
" I support their enthusiasm , " Tarango said about the fans . "

320
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
At the same time , they 're cheering blatantly against me .

321
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
After I won I figured I could give them a little razzle-dazzle . "

322
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
NFL AMERICAN FOOTBALL-RANDALL CUNNINGHAM RETIRES .

324
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Randall Cunningham , the National Football League 's all-time leading rusher as a quarterback and one of the most athletic players ever to line up over centre , retired Thursday .

325
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Cunningham played his entire 11-year career with the Philadelphia Eagles .

326
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
A three-time Pro Bowl selection , Cunningham rushed for 4,482 yards on 677 carries .

327
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
" I would like to thank the Eagles organisation and the wonderful fans of Philadelphia for supporting me throughout my career , " Cunningham said .

328
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
" Although it saddens me to leave , I am looking forward to spending more time with my family and pursuing other interests that have been on the back burner for sometime . "

329
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
" Randall was one of the most exciting quarterbacks in NFL history , " said Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie . "

330
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
During his 11 years in Philadelphia , Randall was the cornerstone of the Eagles ' franchise and brought many great moments to fans in Philadelphia as well as across the NFL . "

331
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
A second-round choice in 1985 , Cunningham completed 1,874-of-3,362 passes ( 55.7 percent ) for 22,877 yards and 150 touchdowns .

332
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000

349
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
MILWAUKEE , Wisconsin 1996-08-29

350
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Nolan Henke fired a nine-under-par 62 to grab a two-shot lead after the opening round of the $ 1.2 million Greater Milwaukee Open Thursday as 20-year-old Tiger Woods shot 67 in his professional debut .

351
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Henke stood two strokes ahead of Bob Estes and three up on Billy Andrade , Duffy Waldorf and Jesper Parnevik .

352
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Woods , who turned pro Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive U.S. Amateur Championship , almost eagled the 18th hole .

353
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He settled for a birdie and a four-under opening round that left him five shots off the pace .

354
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
" Yesterday was the toughest day I 've had for a long time , " Woods said . "

355
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Today , I got to play golf . "

356
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He added : " I thought I got off off to a great start .

357
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It was a perfect start .

358
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I 'm in a good position . "

359
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Henke , who called his round a " pleasant surprise , " finished with six birdies on the final eight holes .

360
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
" We finally got things going in the right direction , " he said . "

361
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It was my best round in a very long time .

362
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
My short game has improved since I 've had to use it so often .

363
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That 's always been the worst part of my game .

364
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
All in all , playing bad 's been a good experience . "

365
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Henke , who came within one shot of the course record set by Andrew Magee during Wednesday 's pro-am , has three career PGA Tour victories , but none since the 1993 BellSouth Classic .

366
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Estes , whose only win came at the 1994 Texas Open and whose best finish this year was a third-place tie at the Nortel Open in January , eagled the par-five fourth hole and added five birdies to grab sole possession of second place .

367
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
" No bogeys on the card , " he noted . "

368
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Sometimes I take more pride in that . "

369
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Woods was among a group of 13 players at four under , including 1993 champion Billy Mayfair , who tied for second at last week 's World Series of Golf , and former U.S. Open champ Payne Stewart .

370
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Defending champion Scott Hoch shot a three-under 68 and was six strokes back .

371
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Phil Mickelson , the only four-time winner on the PGA Tour , skipped the tournament after winning the World Series of Golf last week .

372
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Mark Brooks , Tom Lehman and Mark O'Meara , who make up the rest of the top four on the money list , also took the week off .

MADRID 1996-08-30

375
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Spanish first division team Deportivo Coruna will be without key midfielder Mauro Silva for Saturday 's game with Real Madrid after FIFA , soccer 's world governing body , suspended the Brazilian for one game for missing his national side 's European tour .

376
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Silva excused his absence from Brazil 's game against Russia , on Wednesday , and Saturday 's match with the Netherlands by saying he had lost his passport .

377
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But that did not prevent him from collecting the one-match suspension .

BERLIN 1996-08-30

381
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
American Dennis Mitchell outclassed Olympic 100 metres champion Donovan Bailey for the third time at a major post-Games meeting in front of the most experienced sprinting crowd in the world on Friday .

382
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Watched by an array of former Olympic sprint champions at the Berlin grand prix meeting , Mitchell made a brilliant start in the 100 metres and held off Bailey 's strong finish to win in 10.08 seconds despite cool conditions .

383
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Bailey , who set a world record of 9.84 on his way to victory in Atlanta , could not catch his American rival and had to settle for third in a tight finish .

384
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Jamaica 's Michael Green was second with 10.09 with Bailey finishing in 10.13 .

385
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Last Friday Mitchell , who finished fourth at the Atlanta Games , upstaged a trio of Olympic champions including Bailey to win the 100 in Brussels .

386
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Earlier this month he also beat world champion Bailey in Zurich .

387
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Berlin , Brussels and Zurich all belong to the most lucrative series in the sport , the Golden Four .

388
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Among the crowd on Friday were Olympic 100 metres champions going back to 1948 .

389
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
They had been invited to the meeting to watch a special relay to mark the 60th anniversary of Jesse Owens 's four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in the same Berlin stadium .

390
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
" Today the concentration was the most important thing for me , " Mitchell said .

391
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Despite the coolish conditions American Olympic champion Gail Devers looked in commanding form in the women 's 100 , clocking 10.89 to defeat Jamaican rival Merlene Ottey , who was second in 10.94 .

UEFA came down heavily on Belgian club Standard Liege on Friday for " disgraceful behaviour " in an Intertoto final match against Karlsruhe of Germany .

563
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The Belgian club were fined 25,000 Swiss francs ( $ 20,850 ) for unsporting conduct and captain Guy Hellers banned for seven games .

564
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000

565
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Roberto Bisconti will be sidelined for six Euro ties after pushing the referee in the back as he protested about a Karlsruhe goal , while Didier Ernst was banned for four matches for a verbal attack soon after Bisconti was also dismissed .

566
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000

571
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The International Amateur Athletic Federation said on Friday that a schedule reshuffle had allowed organisers to hold a men 's triple jump as well as the women 's long jump on the " one usable runway at the war-devastated " Kosevo stadium .

572
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Atlanta Games silver medal winner Edwards has called on other leading athletes to take part in the Sarajevo meeting -- a goodwill gesture towards Bosnia as it recovers from the war in the Balkans -- two days after the grand prix final in Milan .

573
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Edwards was quoted as saying : " What type of character do we show by going to the IAAF Grand Prix Final in Milan where there is a lot of money to make but refusing to make the trip to Sarajevo as a humanitarian gesture ? "

577

Baratelli , who played for Nice and Paris St Germain , takes over from Albert Emon who was fired on Thursday after Nice 's home defeat to Guingamp 2-1 in the league .

578

MILAN 1996-08-30

581
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Former Italian international winger Gianluigi Lentini , transferred to Milan in 1992 for what was believed to be a world record sum , has been loaned to serie A club Atalanta for a year , newspapers reported on Friday .

582
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The Gazzetta dello Sport said the deal would cost Atalanta around $ 600,000 .

583
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Lentini , 27 , joined Milan from Torino in a $ 12 million deal that many have speculated involved far more money changing hands and which has subsequently been investigated by magistrates for alleged financial irregularities .

584
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The player suffered severe head injuries in a near-fatal car crash the following year and has since struggled to regain the form that made him a hero in Turin .

585
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The move to Bergamo-based Atalanta reunites Lentini , who fell out with ex-Milan coach Fabio Capello last season , with his former coach at Torino , Emiliano Mondonico .

BUCHAREST 1996-08-30

652
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Romanian listed state engineer Comelf said it almost doubled six-month output , with net profit rising by 33 percent to 1.069 billion lei .

653
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But the company complained inflation and the artificially high rate of the leu cut profit margins on exports , keeping profits well below its forecast of 1.4 billion lei .

654
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Comelf 's six-month output rose to 4,378 tonnes of equipment from 2,684 tonnes in the equivalent period in 1995 , the company report to the Bucharest stock exchange showed .

655
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Comelf , based in the central Transylvanian town of Bistrita , manufactures water purification equipment , machinery for the thermal power sector and other equipment .

656
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
" In the first six months of 1996 we concentrated on increasing the volume of our output and exports in particular and improving the quality of our products , " the report said .

657
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
From January to June Comelf exported 59 percent of its output , up from 37.3 percent in the same period last year .

658
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The company said higher than anticipated inflation and rising raw materials and wage costs also hit profits .

659
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Year-on-year inflation , initially estimated at 20 percent in December , was 33.8 percent in June , higher than a revised end-year forecast of 30 percent .

660
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The 12 month figure quickened to 40.3 percent in July .

661
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The leu currency has slipped only gradually this year , and is currently quoted at an official rate of 3,162 to the dollar , well below the 3,550 retail price that exporters say is more realistic .

698
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
" There was some profit-taking early on , and it 's just sitting there , " a Texas trader said of heating oil 's and gasoline 's losses .

CHICAGO 1996-08-30

711
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
U.S. debt futures finished a shortened pre-holiday session sharply lower , as the markets were shaken by a stronger than expected rise in the August National Association of Purchasing Management ( NAPM ) index for the Chicago area , traders and analysts said .

712
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The August Chicago NAPM rose 8.8 points to 60.0 , its highest level since 62.6 in February 1995 and the largest monthly rise since December 1993 .

713
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Primary dealers immediately sold Eurodollar and bond futures , after the market on average was expecting the index to rise marginally to 51.9 from July 's 51.2 .

714
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Traders also said Japanese investors were unwinding long Eurodollar futures / short swaps , and that heavy put buying helped pressure Eurodollars to lower levels before the close .

715
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
One U.S. firm bought 35,000 September 97 mid-curve put options at a strike price of 93.25 to 93.30 in the last two sessions , while a French firm bought 4,000 September 93.30 to 93.32 put spreads .

716
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
" Even before the data came out , we were seeing put buying , " one floor trader said .

717
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Meanwhile , funds were reportedly good sellers of five-year notes .

718
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Rumors circulated that the Federal Reserve was buying five-year notes , and that a renowned hedge fund manager was buying 10-year notes in the cash markets .

719
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
However , December T-bonds ended below a major trendline level at 106-26/32 , as the yield in the cash bond market set its highest monthly close since April 1995 at 7.12 percent , one analyst said .

720
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
December bonds blew through the July 30 low of 107-06/32 , even though conditions were slightly oversold , traders said .

721
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The December calendar spread continued to widen , also reflecting the market 's fear of rising inflation .

722
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
While the market continues to price-in higher U.S. interest rates , there was little conviction to the theory that the Federal Reserve would tighten rates before the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 24 .

723
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Federal Reserve governor Lawrence Lindsey , speaking on U.S. cable television network CNBC , said the U.S. economy appears on balance to be a bit strong , adding the central bank would not curb growth provided inflation remains in check .

724
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Earlier in the day , Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said at the annual Jackson Hole symposium that the goal of price stability is within reach for major nations .

725
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Traders said the Fed 's decision to adopt a tightening bias at the July FOMC meeting has cast more focus on every piece of U.S. economic news .

726
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
" The Fed 's stance has really sensitized us to all this data , " one analyst said . "

The acquisition will beef up Markham , Ontario-based Magna 's North American car and truck seating business , allowing it to better compete with Johnson Controls Inc and Lear Corp .

736
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Family-controlled Douglas & Lomason , which had 1995 revenue of $ 561 million , was finding it more difficult to compete for new seating contracts from vehicle makers , said James Hoey , chief financial officer .

737
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
" Unfortunately , in the auto industry these days , a $ 500 million company is not a big company anymore , " Hoey said . "

738
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
This merger makes us much more competitive . "

739
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He added that Douglas & Lomason 's top executives have been asked to stay on with Magna after the merger , though their future roles have not yet been defined .

740
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Douglas & Lomason 's profits were hurt in the past year by model changeovers , which had reduced production at some important customers , but are now recovering , analysts said .

741
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The company earned $ 11.2 million on sales of $ 299 million in the first six months of 1996 , up from year-earlier earnings of $ 4.7 million on sales of $ 285.7 million .

743
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
" The deal really levels the seating field somewhat , " said John Casesa of Schroder Wertheim & Co . "

744
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It should give Magna the critical mass to be a bigger player in that market . "

745
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Magna 's traditional strength has been instrument panels , door panels and other interior components .

746
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Magna , Johnson Controls and Lear have been working to build up their capabilties to supply complete interiors to automakers , including seats , instrument panels , door panels carpeting and headliners .

" I would n't get too excited about this one becuase I think it 's for all of five tonnes , which when you think about just about sums up the state of the market at the moment , " said a trader .

755
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Seven Iraqis who seized a Sudanese airliner with 199 people aboard and forced it to fly to London were on Friday charged with hijack , ending speculation that they might be offered immediate asylum in Britain .

756
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Police said the seven men , who freed all their hostages after the plane landed at Stansted airport on Tuesday and then appealed for asylum , would appear in court on Saturday .

757
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The Iraqis claimed they were " ordinary people persecuted by the regime of Saddam ( Hussein ) " but interior ministry officials had consistently said it was likely the seven would be charged with hijack before any plea for asylum was considered .

758
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Under English law the maximum sentence for hijack is life imprisonment , but there has been widespread speculation that the seven will receive lesser sentences and then be allowed to stay rather than being sent back to Iraq .

759
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The hijack began on Monday when an Amman-bound plane was taken over shortly after it took off from Khartoum .

760
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The hijackers threatened to blow it up during a refuelling stop in Cyprus unless they were taken to London .

761
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000

Former world heavyweight champion Frank Bruno has quit the ring on medical advice , Britain 's Sun newspaper reported on Friday .

787
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
An eye specialist told the 35-year-old Bruno that he could be blinded in one eye if he boxed again , the newspaper said .

788
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The Briton , who lost his World Boxing Council ( WBC ) title to Mike Tyson in March , said : " I was in shock as soon as he told me and it still has n't really sunk in .

789
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
" I never wanted to end like this but at the end of the day I 'm glad I had a good innings . "

790
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Bruno , for years one of Britain 's most popular sportsmen , had hoped to have another shot at the world title and had been in training until a routine eye test on Monday highlighted a problem with his right eye .

791
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Professor David McLeod , who examined Bruno , told the Sun : " There is a risk he could be blinded in the eye if he steps into the ring again .

792

Lebed , whom Yeltsin ordered to restore peace in Chechnya , struck a military deal with separatist rebels last week ending the worst fighting in the region in more than a year .

835
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
He later discussed with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov a framework political agreement to tackle the most painful issue of the 20-month war -- the future political status of Chechnya .

836
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Lebed said on Friday he hoped to sign a document with the rebels later in the day which would deal with the political settlement of the conflict .

837
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Moscow , which wants to keep Chechnya as a part of the Russian Federation , sent troops to the region in December 1994 to quell its independence bid .

838

846
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
" We just now signed a statement and attached the basic principles of relations between the Russian Federation and the Chechen Republic , " Lebed told reporters after he and Maskhadov signed a package of documents .

850
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
" Then , with cool heads , calmly and soberly we will sort out our relations , " Lebed said after the late-night signing ceremony in this settlement outside Chechnya 's eastern border .

851
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Tens of thousands of people have died in the war , begun in late 1994 after Moscow sent troops to quell Chechnya 's independence bid .

852
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But Russia failed to win control over the whole of Chechnya and its troops suffered several humiliating defeats .

853

Bosnia 's ruling Moslem nationalist party on Friday called on its refugee voters to end a boycott of absentee balloting in national elections , citing assurances provided by a U.S. envoy , government radio said .

858
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The Bosnian government radio broadcast said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum had reassured SDA officials , including presumably its leader , Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic , whom he met during a Friday visit .

859
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But the radio report did not specify what guarantees , if any , the U.S. envoy had provided .

860

Absentee voting in the elections began on Wednesday , August 28 and runs for a week .

Election day for those living inside Bosnia is September 14 .

862
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The Party of Democratic Action ( SDA ) had called on Wednesday for its followers abroad to boycott the absentee balloting because of voter registration irregularities , especially among Serb refugees .

863
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) postponed municipal elections as a result of the irregularities but decided to proceed with voting for higher offices .

864
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000

Belgrade 's main airport Aerodrom Beograd will be closed to traffic for runway maintenance and modernization from September 21 to 26 , the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported late on Friday .

868
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
" During the works , all flights will be re-routed to the nearby airport in Batajnica , with no change in schedules , " Tanjug quotes Belgrade airport General Director Ljubomir Acimovic as saying .

869
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The airport in Surcin will continue to carry out all other activities and has secured enough buses to transport passengers to Batajnica , Acimovic said .

870
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The value of maintenance works , which will last 120 hours straight , is 20 million dinars and the funds have been secured by Belgrade airport , Tanjug said .

876
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
A senior Belarus politician accused President Alexander Lukashenko on Friday of attempting to set up a dictatorship in the former Soviet republic .

877
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The speaker of the Belarus parliament , Semyon Sharetsky , told Reuters that a draft constitution , due to be put to a national referendum on November 7 , would dangerously increase the powers of the ruler .

878
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
" The world community should not be indifferent to the fact that President Lukashenko , who leads this European state of 10 million people , is trying to establish a dictatorship with his new constitution , " Sharetsky said .

879
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The new constitution calls for a two-chamber parliament with a 110-seat majority-elected house of representatives and a regionally-represented senate with a third of its members named by the president .

880
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Lukashenko 's aides shrugged off Sharetsky 's charge . "

881
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
If there was a dictatorship they would n't have the right to say things like this , " Sergei Posukhov , Lukashenko 's political adviser , told Reuters .

882
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
" The people have asked us to establish order and that 's our main aim . "

883
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Lukashenko , 41 , won presidential polls in 1994 on promises to restore order , fight corruption and repair the strong links with Russia that were disrupted by the collapse of the Soviet Union .

884
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But during his period in office he has battled against nationalist opponents , trade unions and parliament and Sharetsky said the current parliament was ready to try to impeach him .

885
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
" This constitution , which has been prepared in secret , aims to gather all power in one man 's hands , " he said . "

886
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We should not be fooled by his quasi-democratic rhetoric and his methods , like this referendum . "

887
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Lukashenko signed a pact with Moscow in April to create a strong economic and political union which he believes could grow into a federation .

888
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But nationalist groups , scared by the prospect of renewed Moscow domination and Russia 's backing for Lukashenko , protested against the deal .

889
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Lukashenko responded by cracking down on the nationalist opposition and jailing nearly 200 people for taking part in demonstrations against the pact .

Tajik government troops now control of the strategically vital town of Tavildara after driving out Islamic rebels , but sporadic gunfire still echoed in the nearby Pamir mountains on Friday .

895
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The commander-in-chief of Tajikistan 's armed forces , Major-General Nikolai Sherbatov , took a group of journalists by helicopter to the remote , and now devastated , town to show that his forces held it .

896
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He said his troops took Tavildara without casualties on August 23 , but the crack of sniper and machinegun fire revealed the presence of opposition fighters in the surrounding mountains .

897
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Sherbatov said the rebels were located about three km ( two miles ) east of Tavildara around the village of Layron .

898
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Tavildara , 200 km ( 120 miles ) east of the capital Dushanbe , was in ruins .

899
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Shells had smashed roofs and windows and empty shell cases littered the streets .

900
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The town straddles a strategically important road linking government and rebel-held territory and has fallen succesively to both sides in a bloody tug-of-war which began last February .

901
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Tajikistan , which borders Afghanistan and China , has been split by a dragging four-year conflict after a civil war between communists and a frail coalition of Islamic and liberal groups .

902
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Tens of thousands of people have been killed and many more have been displaced in the fighting , which breached a shaky United Nations-sponsored ceasefire .

903
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Tavildara is now apparently inhabited only by a few old men , women and their grubby , barefoot children .

904
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Fruit remained on the trees as there was no one to pick it .

906
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The town 's school and a shop doubling as a warehouse for humanitarian aid were destroyed in the fighting .

907
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
" We had to build our own earth shelters to survive the fighting , " said Rajab Adinayev , a bearded elderly Tajik in a long white shirt .

908
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Although shy in front of the government soldiers , several inhabitants accused government forces of widespread looting of homes and livestock .

909
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
They also said rebel fighters had looted medicines from the local hospital .

910
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
One elderly man , who declined to give his name , said two of his sons were now refugees in Moscow and the other two had left to fight for the opposition .

911
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
He also said government soldiers had raped the wife of one of his sons . "

During Rosati 's trip the two countries will sign an agreement on mutual protection of investments and a note easing conditions on the granting of visas , the agency quoted Foreign Ministry officials as saying .

917
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is the only country of the former Yugoslavia where Poles currently require visas .

918
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
They are also to clinch protocols on culture and understanding between the two foreign ministries .

Earlier Russian news reports had said Yeltsin 's children and grandchildren had visited the Russian first lady but they said only that Yeltsin , on vacation outside Moscow , had spoken to her by telephone .

927
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
" Naina Yeltsin looks well , she is active , she is clearly getting better , " Yastrzhembsky quoted Yeltsin as saying .

928
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Naina Yeltsin is recovering in Moscow 's Central Clinical Hospital , where the president himself was treated twice last year for heart attacks .

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeltsin , 65 , has been seen only rarely since he was elected for a second term in office on July 3 , although his aides have denied a string of rumours that he has been taken ill again .

930
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000

954
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000

955
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
" Obviously , at some point it represents a buying opportunity , " Frater said . "

Net profit for the January-June 1996 period was 2.1 million French francs , down from 10.3 million in the first six months of 1995 , with the bulk of this decline attributable to the performance of Petofi , one of its Hungarian units .

960
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Cofinec said Petofi general manager Laszlo Sebesvari had submitted his resignation and will be leaving Petofi but will remain on Petofi 's board of directors .

984

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The judge overturned a decision to shut down Hen Vipheak 's newspaper .

994
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The editor was prosecuted following a May 1995 article alleging top-level corruption .

995
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Sihanouk promised an amnesty to Hen Vipheak , along with fellow KNP member and journalist Chan Rattana , who was released after serving a week of a year-long jail term in June .

996
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Co-Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen agreed earlier this week to the king 's request for an amnesty .

997
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Far East Gold - Moribund market seen continuing .

HONG KONG 1996-08-30

1000
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Far East gold traders thumped foreheads in frustration at the market 's foot-dragging this week and forecast on Friday that next week would not be much better .

1001
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The Southeast Asian gold market was more or less a photo-fit picture of the previous week 's position with activity slow and bullion prices trapped in a well-worn range awaiting a seasonal upturn in demand and prices into the fourth quarter .

1002
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Singapore premiums for Australian kilo bars were quoted unchanged at between 25-45 cents an ounce over spot loco London prices , with South Korean and Indonesian-origin premiums also steady at 10-20 cents an ounce .

1003
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Singapore dealers said they were concerned that there had been a marked revival in offers to sell gold by South Korean traders , following the distress sales of recent months after the Seoul government 's crackdown on bullion arbitrage trade .

1004
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
" I was shocked to see these offers coming in again , though there 's been no indication of price or volume .

1005
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I dread to think what will happen to the premiums if the Koreans start selling in force , " one dealer said .

1006
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Continued dishoarding of kilo-bars by Indonesian sources ahead of next year 's presidential election has also kept a lid on premiums .

1007
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Gold closed down at $ 387.00 / $ 387.50 an ounce in Hong Kong on Friday , versus New York 's $ 387.60 / $ 388 finish on Thursday .

1008
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Dealers said the precious metal eased on a report that the International Monetary Fund might sell some of its gold to reduce the debts of the poorest developing countries .

1009
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Easier silver prices mid-week helped keep spot gold locked in a $ 386 - $ 389 an ounce range , dealers said , but they remained optimistic that the usual seasonal pick-up in jewellery fabrication demand would see gold at $ 395 by end-October .

1010
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
" I still think we 'll see gold at $ 395 by the end of October , in a retracement of the $ 418 - $ 380 move we saw at the start of the year , " one said .

1011
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Silver , basis the September contract on New York 's Comex market , was expected to find support at between $ 5.12 - $ 5.15 an ounce and meet resistance from $ 5.25 - $ 5.30 , they added .

1012
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
September silver closed up $ 0.004 in New York on Thursday at $ 5.255 an ounce .

1013
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Tripoli decks out for coup celebrations .

TRIPOLI 1996-08-30

1016
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Libyans are dressing up their capital Tripoli for celebrations on Sunday of the 27th anniversary of the coup which brought Muammar Gaddafi to power .

1017
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Green flags and banners praise the " great revolution " and promise defiance against United Nations sanctions imposed for Libya 's refusal to hand over for trial two suspects wanted in connection with the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie , Scotland .

1018
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
" We have chosen the challenge because it is our only option , " proclaimed one banner on the road to Tripoli airport which serves only internal flights because of the sanctions .

1019
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Huge stadium lights are directed at the city 's Green Square where makeshift stages await Sunday 's festivities .

1020
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Three African leaders -- from Niger , Guinea and Ghana -- are expected to attend the celebrations marking September 1 , 1969 when a group of young army officers , led by a 27-year-old Gaddafi , deposed King Mohammed Idris .

1021
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
" The revolution has brought us great achievements ...

1022
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
We are comfortable the revolution has taken care of us , improved our lives and given us capabilites , " Samer Ammar Soliman , 42 , told Reuters as he came out of Friday prayers .

1023
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But some Libyans have begun to show their discontent in the country 's east , which has become a hotbed of militant violence .

1024
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Tripoli-based diplomats and exiled opponents said Gaddafi 's airforce blasted in July rebel strongholds in the mountainous Jebel al-Akhdar region .

1025
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Travellers arriving in Egypt say militants and police officers clash regularly in Benghazi .

1026
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
At least 20 people were killed in the capital in early July after bodyguards loyal to Gaddafi 's sons fired at spectators of a football match who were chanting subversive slogans .

1027
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Gaddafi has dismissed any unrest as the work of foreigners , and last year deported thousands of Sudanese and Egyptian workers .

1028
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Twilight zone for Wall Street as political race heats up .

1029

Pierre Belec

1030
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
NEW YORK 1996-08-30

1031
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
For Wall Street , this is the season to be cautious as the presidential contest puts the stock market in the twilight zone .

1032
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
President Clinton , Bob Dole and Ross Perot are hitting the road now that the partying is over , and people who have billions of dollars invested in stocks were bracing for political promises that could have an impact on their wealth .

1033
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Analysts believe that the candidates will add to the market 's list of uncertainties , which already includes the question of whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to cool economic growth .

1034
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
They say the politicians will need to promote legislation that helps the economy without scaring the socks off financial markets .

1035
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
" The worst thing that could happen for financial markets is that if Clinton and Dole start to trade shots in the middle of the ring with one-upmanship , " said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. " That 's when Wall Street will need to worry . "

1036
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He said that the bond market would be the first to react if the " bidding " intensifies and stocks would quickly drop as interest rates rise .

1037
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
" I do n't think it would imply the collapse of the stock market , unless the rise in rates touches off a dynamic within the market , which would include selling by portfolio managers , redemptions by individuals of mutual funds that would , in turn , pressure the portfolio managers to sell even more stock . "

1038
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
This week , the market weighed Dole 's proposal to lower federal income taxes by 15 percent across the board , a package that carries a price tag of $ 548 billion .

1039
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Clinton proposes an $ 8.4 billion re-election agenda that would spare most home-sellers from capital gains taxes and give employers tax incentives to hire people off the welfare rolls .

1040
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Clinton claims Dole 's plan would increase the deficit , while the White House said some corporate taxes would be raised to offset the cost of the president 's plan .

1041
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The experts said there are some unusual risks for the market from this year 's political season because the rush to promise tax cuts to win votes could upset Wall Street 's expectations that Washington will balance the budget .

1042
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
" The stock market will have to edit the promises and then do a probability study on those edited promises , " said John Geraghty at the consulting firm North American Equity Services .

1043
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
During the past four presidential elections , the candidate that has favoured tax cuts has won .

1044
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Ronald Reagan 's tax cut won him a second four-year term in the White House in 1984 , while Democrat Walter Mondale , who promised higher taxes , lost .

1045
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
George Bush became president in 1988 on his no-new-tax campaign and Clinton won in 1992 with a promise to fatten workers ' paychecks .

1046
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The trick , they said , will be for the candidates to continue to convince Wall Street that the Treasury 's 30-year bond -- the most closely-watched interest rate -- will fall to between 4 percent and 5 percent by the end of the decade .

1047
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Johnson said that long-term interest rates have already been spooked by the election .

1048
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The long-term bond jumped this week to 7.13 percent after starting the year at 5.95 percent .

1049
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The surge of buying in stocks during the last two years has come amid an environment of low interest rates , which has boosted corporate profits .

1050
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But the market stalled this summer after the Dow Jones industrial average set a record high of 5,778.00 points on May 22 .

1051
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
" The market does n't seem to be able to make new highs and it has been back and forth in a fairly horizontal mode which looks like a holding pattern , " said Geraghty .

1052
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
He said the market reflects the political uncertainty , now that Dole has sharply narrowed the gap with Clinton in the polls .

1053
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Geraghty said that the one thing that could completely turn the election around are new findings in the Whitewater scandal that would damage the Clintons .

1054
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
" Stocks are on a delicate edge because if something happens that looks like it could upset the presidency , it could throw the political and , to some extent the economic , process into chaos , " Geraghty said .

1055
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Right now , Wall Street is pondering the candidates .

1056
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
" We have an election where there are so many unknown variables that most people will probably want to hold fire , and even take the chance that they will have to pay higher prices for stocks after the November election , than take the risk that a shock to the system will hurt the stock market , " Geraghty said .

1057
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
On Friday , the Dow Jones index closed down 31.44 points at 5,616.21 .

1058
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
For the week , it was down 106.53 points .

1059
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The Nasdaq composite index closed 3.53 points lower Friday at 1,141.50 .

1060
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
For the week , it was down 1.55 points .

1061
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The Standard & Poor 's index of 500 stocks was off 5.41 points at 651.99 , down 15.03 points for the week .

1062
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The American Stock Exchange index was down 1.66 points at 559.68 , and was off 1.26 for the week .

1063
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Brisk economic reports rattle markets anew .

1064

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
WASHINGTON 1996-08-30

1066
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Factory orders rose in July and manufacturing surged in the Midwest in August , reports said Friday , sparking worries about inflation that battered financial markets for a second straight day .

1067
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods climbed 1.8 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion -- nearly twice the increase that had been expected .

1068
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Shipments of everything from new cars to food items rose , as did order backlogs , in a sign that the strength in the industrial sector would continue in coming months .

1069
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
A separate report from Chicago area purchasing managers underlined the strength in manufacturing as the group 's barometer of manufacturing in the region jumped to 60 in August from 51.2 in July .

1070
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing .

1071
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
While production and orders rose at Midwest area businesses , the prices they paid for goods used in manufacturing remained well in check .

1072
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Analysts said the reports implied the economy was not slowing down in the third quarter after a burst of growth in the spring , and that the lull in late June and July was more temporary than Federal Reserve policy-makers had wanted .

1073
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
" It appears that August is showing an economy again reversing course and is not moving onto a significantly slower track at this point , " said economist Lynn Reaser of Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville , Fla .

1074
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The reports fanned worries on Wall Street that the Fed , the nation 's central bank , would raise rates next month in a bid to ward off inflation , driving stock and bond prices sharply lower for a second day running .

1075
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
The 30-year Treasury fell almost a point , raising its yield , which moves in the opposite direction from the price , to 7.12 percent from 7.04 percent late Thursday .

1076
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.44 points to 5,616.21 after a 64.73-point decline Thursday .

1077
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
A third report from the Commerce Department , on July personal income and spending , pointed to a potential slowdown in consumer spending that some analysts said may help moderate growth in the second half .

1078
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It showed spending rose only 0.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June .

1079
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June .

1080
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest in six months , since January when they were flat .

1081
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Economist Joel Naroff of First Union bank in Philadelphia said consumer spending , which fuels two-thirds of the nation 's economy , may be much slower in the third quarter than in the first half , which should slow economic growth .

1082
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
" The FOMC ( Federal Open Market Committee ) has been forecasting a slowing in economic activity and moderating household demand will have a large impact on overall economic growth , " Naroff said in a written comment .

1083
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The policy-making FOMC is to meet on Sept .

1084
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
24 to plot interest-rate strategy .

1085
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It already has adopted a bias toward raising rates to keep a lid on wage and price rises and help sustain the 5-1 / 2-year-old economic expansion .

1086
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
In an interview on the cable television network CNBC Friday , Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence Lindsey said there still were " mixed signals " about the economy 's direction .

1087
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
" I think that , on balance , it is looking a little bit on the strong side , " Lindsey said .

1088
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
He added that with expansion as solid as it is and with unemployment so low " the greater risks are clearly that we might see some overheating . "

1089
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
While July consumer spending rose only slightly , there were ample indications that consumers remained confident .

1090
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The University of Michigan 's August index of consumer sentiment , made available on Friday to paying subscribers , rose to 95.3 from 94.7 in July .

1091
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Reaser said strong consumer confidence coupled with relatively lean inventories were providing manufacturers with a reason to gear up production .

1092
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
" The economy is not going to be expanding at the 4.8 percent ( annual ) rate that we had in the second quarter but it is likely to keep expanding in the 3 percent range , " she said , above the 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent that the Fed considers to be non-inflationary .

1093
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
New orders to factories were strong for durable goods like new cars and for nondurables like paper and food products .

1094
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Orders for durable goods , meant to last three years or more , rose a revised 1.7 percent in July after falling 0.2 percent in June .

1095
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Orders for nondurables jumped 1.8 percent following a 1.2 percent decrease in June .

1096
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Mexican avocados not expected in U.S .

1097

Maggie McNeil

1098
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
WASHINGTON 1996-08-30

1099
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
U.S. Agriculture Department officials said Friday that Mexican avocados -- which are restricted from entering the continental United States -- will not likely be entering U.S. markets any time soon , even if the controversial ban were lifted today .

1100
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
" The opportunity to import ( Mexican avocados ) probably wo n't become possible for another year , " said Paul Drazek , senior trade advisor to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman .

1101
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
" We could lift the ban tomorrow , but that would not mean anything immediately , " said Drazek . "

1102
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
We probably would not see avacados come in until next season , next November . "

1103
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The Agriculture Department proposed more than a year ago to significantly ease an 82-year ban on Mexican avocados .

1104
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Under the administration 's proposal , the borders to the Mexican produce would be opened into 19 Northern and Northeastern states from November through February .

1105
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The plan has raised a storm of protest from U.S. avocado growers , who are largely concentrated in California .

1106
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
California growers have charged that removing the restrictions , even on a limited basis , would endanger the $ 1 billion U.S. industry if potentially harmful Mexican insects were brought into the country along with the avocados .

1107
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Mexican officials contend that there is no scientific basis for the ban , and that it is illegal under international trading rules of the World Trade Organisation .

1108
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Proponents of the plan discount the worries of the U.S. growers and say the plan has enough safeguards built into it to eliminate any significant threat to American producers .

1109
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Under the proposal , only imports of export-quality avocados growing in approved orchards in Michoacan , Mexico , the country 's main avocado area , would be allowed .

1110
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Mexican growers and distributors would have to abide by strict rules established by the Mexican and U.S. agriculture agencies .

1111
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The California Avocado Commission -- which has spearheaded the opposition to lifting the ban -- said new data the group submitted to the Agriculture Department last spring shows the department underestimated the pest problem in Mexico and have urged that the agency reopen its study of the issue .

1112
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The administration is still studying the new data , and officials have said that if experts think the information is significant , the agency could reopen its investigation .

1113
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But U.S. avocado industry sources said that while they may have delayed the plan for a while , they ultimately do not expect the administration to change its position .

1114
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
" From a common-sense view , the department should reconsider this plan , but due to politics they will probably go ahead with this , " said Tom Bellamore of the California avocado group .

1115
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Administration officials said they want to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible , but said there is no timetable they are working under .

1116
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
" It 's a very complicated issue , " said the Agriculture Department 's Drazek . "

1117
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
We 'll get it resolved as quickly as we can , based on the best available science . "

U.S. Cardinal Bernardin says has terminal cancer .

1119
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
CHICAGO 1996-08-30

1120
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin , head of the second-largest U.S. Roman Catholic archdiocese , said on Friday his doctors had diagnosed him as having liver cancer and he had a year or less to live .

1121
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Bernardin , 68 , underwent extensive surgery for pancreatic cancer in June 1995 followed by months of chemotherapy , which he said made him more aware of his own vulnerabilities and the need to minister to the sick .

1122
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
" On Wednesday , examinations indicated that the cancer has returned , this time in the liver .

1123
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I am told that it is terminal and that my life expectancy is one year or less , " a composed Bernardin told a news conference .

1124
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
In 14 years as Chicago 's archbishop , he built a prayerful , saintly image and was deeply involved in world church issues and publicly committed to rooting out abuses by clergy .

1125
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
" I have been assured that I still have some quality time left , " he said , saying he would undergo a new form of chemotherapy but his doctors have told him there was only a slim chance of a cure and the liver cancer was inoperable .

1126
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
" It 's not going to be easy to say goodbye to everybody .

1127
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Death does have some sad dimensions to it but I am a man of faith , " he said . "

1128
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Death is a natural phenomenom . "

1129
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
He said he would " serve until the end " as cardinal .

1130
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly forms of the disease , although Bernardin 's case was caught early .

1131
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Surgeons removed a cancerous kidney , parts of his pancreas and stomach , small intestine , bile duct and surrounding tissues .

1132
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
He made a rapid recovery and resumed most of his duties , but then developed a deteriorating condition in his spine that caused him great pain and shortened his height by several inches .

1133
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He was scheduled to undergo back surgery next month , but that was cancelled when the cancer was discovered in his liver in order to avoid delaying the start of chemotherapy .

1134
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The spare , soft-spoken son of an Italian stonecutter took over the Chicago archdiocese , the nation 's second-largest after Los Angeles , with 2.3 million parishioners , in 1982 .

1135
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Ironically , Bernardin , who developed a progressive , much-praised programme to deal with pedophilia involving priests , became the highest-ranking church official ever accused of sexual improprieties when a former seminary student leveled charges in 1993 that he had been sexually abused by Bernardin during the 1970s .

1136
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Bernardin steadfastly denied the charges and the former student later recanted his tale of abuse .

1137
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Bernardin prayed with him before he died from AIDS last year .

1138
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Bernardin , who became archbishop of Cincinnati in 1972 , played an increasingly prominent role in the U.S. church as a moderate voice of compromise among liberals and conservatives in the ranks of the bishops .

1139
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
This month , he announced that he would oversee a series of conferences to find " common ground " among American Catholics .

1140
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Previously , he was instrumental in drafting church policy on war , peace and nuclear arms , and for seven years he headed the bishops ' anti-abortion policy committee , espousing a policy describing human life as a " seamless garment . "

1141
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Boatmen 's deal could spark more mergers .

1143
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
CHICAGO 1996-08-30

1144
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The $ 9.5 billion proposed acquisition of Boatmen 's Bancshares Inc. by NationsBank Corp. could spark a flurry of other mergers involving Missouri banks , which until last year were protected from outside buyers by state regulations .

1145
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
" NationsBank just strolled into the Midwest and bagged the biggest banking trophy in the landscape , " said Michael Ancell , banking industry analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co . "

1146
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Whoever wants a big market position in the Midwest has to come in and grab Mercantile or Commerce . "

1147
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
St. Louis-based Mercantile Bancorp Inc. , a bank holding company with $ 18.04 billion in assets , was seen by many analysts as the most attractive Missouri franchise in size after Boatmen 's .

1148
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Kansas City , Mo.-based Commerce Bancshares Inc. , with $ 9.32 billion in assets , also could help a regional bank establish a strong presence in the lower Midwest , analysts added .

1149
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
" It focuses more attention on Mercantile , Commerce and Roosevelt , " said James Weber , analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons .

1150
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Roosevelt Financial Group Inc is a $ 9.33 billion asset-St .

Louis based thrift .

1152
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
" Now ... the most coveted bank out there is Mercantile , " Weber said .

1153
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Mercantile and Commerce did not return phone calls seeking comment .

1154
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Among those seen as having an interest in buying in Missouri are Minneapolis-based First Bank System Inc. and Norwest Corp. , Ohio-based KeyCorp and Banc One Corp. , and First Chicago NBD Corp. in Illinois .

1155
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Representatives of First Bank , Norwest , Banc One and First Chicago said the banks do not comment on rumors of possible mergers or acquisitions .

1156
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
KeyCorp , contacted by phone , would not comment .

1157
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
With a presence in nine states and $ 41 billion in assets ,

1158
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Boatmen 's was the prize in Missouri , where barriers to outside acquirers were brought down last year by a federal banking statute .

1159
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
" Boatmen 's was the plum of Missouri and was the plum of the central Midwest , " Weber said .

1160
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Talk that the Missouri banks were seeking inflated prices from buyers was seen as a reason a deal has not occurred sooner .

1161
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
But NationsBank 's bid , representing a premium of 40 percent for Boatmen 's stock , was large enough to get the deal done .

1162
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
" I think Boatmen 's was shopping itself , and everybody knew if you wanted to be the winning buyer here , you had to make the bid nobody would beat , " Ancell said .

1163
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But some analysts cautioned that other targets should not expect as large a premium .

1164
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
They also questioned whether NationsBank can recoup shareholder value with such a large bid for Boatmen 's .

1165
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
" I think initially some stocks will trade up on sympathy , but the wild premium NationsBank put on this deal here , I do n't see a lot of other deals being done at this premium , " said Michael Durante , analyst at McDonald & Co .

U.S. tight-lipped on Libya 's award to Farrakhan .

1167
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
WASHINGTON 1996-08-30

1168
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The State Department refused to speculate on Friday on what might happen in the case of Louis Farrakhan , the U.S. black leader who was awarded a $ 250,000 human rights prize by Libya .

1169
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
" I 'm not going to speculate about what may or may not happen in that case , " State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said . "

1170
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
... The view of the U.S. government on ( Farrakhan 's ) not accepting any gifts from Libya is well-known . "

1171
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Davies also noted : " We 've talked about the passport restriction for travel to Libya " but he did not elaborate .

1172
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday denied Farrakhan 's application to receive the $ 250,000 award or a $ 1 billion donation Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had pledged to Farrakhan 's Nation of Islam group after they met last January .

1173
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Farrakhan organised last October 's Million Man March that brought thousands of black men to Washington for a peaceful rally .

1174
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
The Treasury Department said Libya was on the U.S. list of states that sponsor international terrorism and noted that Tripoli has refused to hand over two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland .

1175
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That refusal led to the imposition of U.N. sanctions on Libya .

1178
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
There were 162 rigs under contract in the U.S. Gulf as of August 30 , down one from the prior week , Offshore Data Services said .

1179
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The utilization rate for rigs working in the Gulf , based on a total fleet of 181 , was 89.5 percent .

1180
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The number of working rigs in European / Mediterranean remained unchanged this week , with 105 rigs under contract out of a total fleet of 105 , a utilization rate of 100 percent .

1181
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The worldwide rig count fell by one to 554 out of a total fleet of 608 , making the utilization rate 91.1 percent .

1186
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The Dole campaign released a letter Friday inviting their Clinton counterparts to meet with Dole campaign manager Scott Reed to discuss particulars of the televised debates .

1187
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
" Next week , a small group of representatives from each of our campaigns should meet to address participants , format , timing and logistical issues surrounding the debates , " Dole campaign manager Scott Reed wrote to Clinton campaign manager Peter Knight .

1188
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Tentative dates for the debates are Sept .

A decision is expected by mid-September on whether Texas billionaire Ross Perot , the Reform Party candidate , will be allowed to participate in the debates , which are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates , a non-profit , non-partisan organisation that took over the forums in 1988 from the League of Women Voters .

NEW YORK 1996-08-30

1196
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Equipment problems and mechanical failure forced a recovery expedition to give up efforts to retrieve a giant slab of the RMS Titanic from the ocean floor , a spokeswoman said on Friday .

1197
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
A 20-ton piece of the Titanic 's steel hull , which had been attached by cables to a recovery ship off the coast of Newfoundland , Canada , fell back to the bottom of the sea , said Erin Purcell of Boston-based Reagan Communications that represents two of the ships used in the expedition .

1198
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The piece of hull , lifted from the ocean floor by means of several diesel-filled bags , had been stuck about 200 feet ( about 70 metres ) below the water 's surface before it fell , she said .

1199
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It fell as recovery crews were trying to haul the piece into more shallow water and several of the bags burst and cables snapped , she said .

1200
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The steel-hulled Titanic , thought to be unsinkable , struck an iceberg on April 14 , 1912 , and sank , killing 1,523 of the 2,200 passengers and crew on board .

1201
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
The wreck was located in 1985 .

1202
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Passengers who had paid $ 1,500 and up to accompany the recovery expedition on two cruise ships had returned back to port on Thursday , Purcell said .

The German government urged Israelis and Palestinians on Friday to avoid any course of action that might jeopardise the peace process in the Middle East .

1206
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Israel announced this week the expansion of Jewish West Bank settlements surrounding Jerusalem and the demolition of an Arab community centre in East Jerusalem .

1207
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
City officials there said the centre was being erected illegally .

1208
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said the moves by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's government were tantamount to war .

1209
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Tension has been rising in the region since .

1210
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
" We believe that the Israeli settlement policy in the occupied areas is an obstacle to the establishment of peace , " German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said .

1211
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
" All concerned must avoid taking any course of action that could pose an obstacle to the peace process and which could make a peaceful solution difficult , " he said , as news came of a renewed breakdown in Arab-Israeli peace talks in Jerusalem .

1212
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Erdmann told reporters Bonn supported European Union efforts to persuade Israel to stop further Jewish settlement on the West Bank .

1213
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The foreign ministry later announced Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy would visit Bonn for talks with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel next month .

1214
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The ministry said Levy and Kinkel would discuss the Middle East process and German-Israeli relations at their meeting on September 9 .

1215
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Levy 's visit would be the first by an Israeli cabinet minister since Netanyahu 's conservative government took power in une this year , the ministry said .

1216
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Before Levy 's arrival in Bonn , German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe will visit Israel from September 2 to 4 , the defence ministry said .

1217
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Ruehe planned to meet his Israeli counterpart Yitzhak Mordechai and Israeli President Ezer Weizman , the ministry said .

1218
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
He was also expected to meet Prime Minister Netanyahu and opposition leader Shimon Peres for talks .

1221
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
France on Friday expelled another African man seized in a police raid on a Paris church as about 100 Air France workers denounced " charters of shame " used to fly illegal immigrants home .

1222
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
A Guinean man , detained in a round-up in the Saint-Bernard church a week ago , was deported on a scheduled Air France flight to Conakry after his appeals failed , a spokesman for Air France 's pro-Socialist CFDT union said .

1223
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
He was apparently the eighth African deported from among 210 people evicted from the church after a 50-day occupation aimed at securing residence permits , unions said .

1224
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Most of the others have been released after a brief stay in detention .

1225
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
About 100 people from the CFDT and the Communist-led CGT unions marched outside Air France headquarters at Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris against the use of civilian jets and staff in deporting illegal immigrants .

1226
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
" We must obtain a formal commitment from ( Air France chairman ) Christian Blanc that no plane , no personnel be used to transform our air companies into charters of shame , " CFDT spokesman Francois Cabrera said .

1227
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
He said civilians should not be police accomplices .

1228
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Twenty-three out of 25 charters flying illegal immigrants home since Prime Minister Alain Juppe 's government took office in May 1995 have been civilian jets .

1229
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
The other two were military jets .

1230
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Separately , Juppe confirmed the conservative government was preparing to submit a draft bill to parliament to tighten laws on illegal workers as part of a crackdown on immigration .

1231
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
" Legislation is insufficient in several areas , notably in those concerning illegal work , " Juppe told reporters .

Police suspect Nicole Nichterwitz 's aunt and a male companion abducted the girl and took her to the Netherlands .

WASHINGTON 1996-08-30

1401
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Consumer spending barely edged up in July , the Commerce Department said Friday , as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months .

1402
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Spending rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June .

1403
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June .

1404
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Department officials said July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since January , when they were flat .

1405
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Wages and salaries came under pressure in July as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks .

1406
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The department said wages and salaries decreased by $ 6.9 billion in July after climbing $ 45 billion in June .

1407
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
" In July , average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined , more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment , " Commerce said .

1408
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But more money went into savings accounts , as savings held at 5.3 cents out of each dollar earned in both June and July .

1409
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
That was the highest savings rate since October last year , when 5.5 cents out of each dollar earned was being saved .

1410
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in July had been expected .

1411
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
At the same time , the department said in a separate report that new orders received by U.S. factories climbed strongly in July , with widespread gains across most major categories .

1412
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Orders increased 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion , significantly stronger than the 1 percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists .

1413
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That followed a revised 0.7 percent decline in June orders .

1414
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only 0.1 percent in July , partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks .

1415
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
In addition , the Labour Department 's July employment report had foreshadowed the muted income growth .

1416
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It showed average hourly earnings fell in July by 0.2 percent to $ 11.00 and the average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.7 in June .

1417
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Gains in personal income , which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends , interest and businesses , are essential for funding consumer purchases , which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity .

1418
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Spending on all types of durable goods , which includes cars , fell to an annual rate of $ 626.3 billion in July from $ 633.6 billion in June .

1419
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
But spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of $ 1.55 trillion from $ 1.54 trillion in June , while spending for services was up to $ 2.97 trillion in July from $ 2.96 trillion .

1420
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Payrolls of manufacturing companies rose in July by $ 2.3 billion to an annual rate of $ 678 billion .

STOCKS SINK AS BOND RATES JUMP ON STRONG DATA

1433
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Blue-chip stocks sank to their biggest loss since mid-July Thursday as fresh signs of a surprisingly strong economy boosted long-term bond interest rates above 7 percent .

1434
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
The dollar rose slightly against the German mark , but edged lower against the Japanese yen .

In the broader market , declining issues beat advances 1,627 to 743 on moderate volume of 321 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange .

1437

In the bond market , the 30-year Treasury bond fell 23/32 of a point , or $ 7.1875 on a $ 1,000 bond , raising its yield to 7.04 percent -- the highest since July 31 -- from 6.98 percent at Wednesday 's close .

1438
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
" Seven percent creates psychological problems and a legitimate competitor for money from equities , " said Ralph Bloch , chief technical analyst at Raymond James .

1439
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
" We could carry another 100 points lower in the Dow , " he said . "

Fears of a Fed tightening next month have resurfaced for the first time since the end of July . "

1448
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The Commerce Department reported that the nation 's gross domestic product expanded at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the three months from April through June instead of the 4.2 percent estimated a month ago .

1449
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
In another report , sales of new homes jumped unexpectedly in July to the briskest rate in five months , driving prices up in a strong housing market .

1450
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Sales shot up 7.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 783,000 units -- the strongest since February , when new homes were selling at a rate of 784,000 a year .

1451
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Analysts said the stock market was also worried about the impact on President Clinton 's re-election bid of his top political strategist resigning .

1452
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Dick Morris , who is credited with resurrecting Clinton 's political fortunes over the past 18 months by masterminding his turn to the political centre , quit after a supermarket tabloid reported he engaged in a yearlong affair with a prostitute , with whom he allegedly shared confidential campaign documents .

1453
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Analysts said Wall Street had grown accustomed to a moderate Republican in the form of Democratic President Clinton .

1454
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Morris ' departure raised fears that Clinton would veer more to the left in a second term .

1455
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The dollar closed at 1.4772 marks , up from 1.4767 late Wednesday .

1456
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
The dollar slipped to 108.40 yen from 108.45 .

1457
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Oil markets rose sharply on a combination of low stocks , two hurricanes and allegations of illicit trading by Iraq .

1458

September heating oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed 1.63 cents higher at 63.67 cents a gallon , September unleaded gasoline finished 1.39 cents up at 63.72 cents a gallon and October crude rose 44 cents to $ 22.15 a barrel .

MILAN 1996-08-30

1465
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Italian tyre and cables giant Pirelli on Friday announced its long-awaited move into China with a cables joint venture set to capitalise on the rapidly-growing Chinese telecommunications market .

1466
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Pirelli is linking with Hong Kong-based group CITIC Pacific in a venture to be called the Wuxi Tong Ling Company Ltd , which will operate in partnership with a local industrial company at its existing factory in Wuxi , Jiangsu province , Shanghai .

1467
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
The partners will invest around $ 30 million in the existing copper cable plant at Wuxi to update technology and include optic fibre production , with annual turnover expected to reach $ 60 million within the next few years .

1468
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
The move marks a further move by Pirelli 's cables division to expand in the fast-growing Far Eastern developing markets with the group already present in Indonesia , India and Malaysia .

1469
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
" This is really positive news for Pirelli , and I expect that it will produce one of the best half-year results in late September compared to other industrial Italian companies , " said analyst Paula Buratti at Indosuez .

1470
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
She emphasised that the move was positive because Pirelli will have management control of the Chinese venture , and it also showed another example of Pirelli exporting its technical know-how to developing markets .

1471
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Pirelli shares reacted favourable even though talks had been underway for some time and news about a venture had been widely expected .

1472
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The shares rose 0.2 percent to 2,555 lire by 1350 GMT in an easier Milan stock market .

1473
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
This will be Pirelli 's first industrial involvement in a Chinese market where demand for telecommunication networks is expected to grow to 80-100 million new lines between 1996 and 2000 , doubling demand for optical cables .

1474
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
China 's second largest telecoms operator Unicom already has a mandate from the central government to establish 15 million new phone lines by the year 2000 , which will necessitate new trunk line systems and local distribution networks .

1475
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
" The starting of this production base in China has for our group an undoubted strategic value , representing an important enhancement of our presence in Asia , " said Pirelli SpA chairman and chief executive officer Marco Tonchetti Provera .

1476
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Pirelli Cables has global sales of over $ 3.5 billion , and has become a large supplier of optic cables and systems to major telecoms carriers in the U.S. , Europe and the Far East .

1477
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
CITIC Pacific is a major Hong Kong-listed company focusing on infrastruture , trading , distribution and property , with 28 percent of its 1995 profits coming from telecoms .

1478
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It has investments in several industrial joint ventures in China .

AMSTERDAM 1996-08-30

1481
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
A broad attempt to spur activity in Dutch bond futures has been delayed to give participants a chance to become familiar with the trading system , the European Options Exchange ( EOE ) said on Friday .

1482
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Market-making in the rarely-traded FTO contract was expected to begin today , but an EOE spokesman said the 10 banks and brokers involved in the initiative needed time to get accustomed to changes in the electronic trading system .

1483
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
" It 's not ready yet .

1484
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
We found it wise to take some time between the commitment to start and the actual start , " EOE spokesman Lex van Drooge told Reuters .

1485
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
He said no date had been fixed yet for the start of price making in the 10-year contract , but the EOE had agreed to speak again to the participants in one to two weeks .

1486
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Investors in Dutch bonds currently use German bond futures to hedge their portfolios because the FTO contract is so illiquid .

1487
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
A limited attempt to reinvigorate the contract two years ago failed .

BONN 1996-08-30

1491
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
The head of an international mediating mission defended its record on Friday in the face of criticism by pro-Moscow leaders in breakway Chechnya and insisted it was doing its best to bring peace to the region .

1492
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Flavio Cotti , the chairman of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , told German radio the Vienna-based body viewed the conflict in Chechnya as an internal Russian problem .

1493
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
" The OSCE is completely involved .

1494
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
But one must not forget that the OSCE only has limited powers there , " said Cotti , who is also the Swiss foreign minister . "

1495
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Our mission in Chechnya has done all it can within the given limitations . "

1496
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Pro-Moscow leaders in Chechnya have criticised Tim Guldimann , the Swiss diplomat who heads the OSCE Chechnya mission , saying he was biased toward Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev , president of the self-declared separatist government .

1497
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and Chechen separatist military leader Aslan Maskhadov started a new round of peace talks on Friday just outside the rebel region .

1498
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Cotti said Chechnya must remain part of Russia , but the solution to the conflict would be to accord the region maximum autonomy within Russia 's borders .

1499
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
" There is no doubt that Chechnya , according to OSCE principles , belongs to a state called Russia , " he said , pointing out that Russia was an OSCE member and it was not the organisation 's policy to challenge members ' sovereignty .

1500
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
He added that the OSCE was the only international body which has been allowed into the Chechnya to monitor the human rights situation there , but that its means were restricted by the fact that the conflict was a " internal issue " .

1501
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
" We have a small concept , the details of which have yet to be worked out .

1502
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Chechnya must be accorded the maximum autonomy possible within the framework of Russian integrity , " said Cotti .

The Dutch transport minister Annemarie Jorritsma told the country ' second chamber that there is no further need to investigate the 1992 crash of an El Al freighter which left 43 dead in an Amsterdam suburb .

1506
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
She said that a request from her ministry for the aircraft 's waybill documentation and further information about the contents of its hold had been complied with by El Al 's head office in Tel Aviv .

The Dutch transport ministry had come in for pressure from a cross-section of Dutch members of parliaments in May this year , some of whom believed the aircraft had been carrying unlisted , dangerous goods .

1508
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Others said they thought the aircraft was loaded with too much airfreight .

1509
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Jorritsma said the latest evidence from El Al in no way supported the allegations , and added there is no justification for a further investigation into the incident .

BONN 1996-08-30

1513
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Representatives from Armenia and Azerbaijan held talks earlier this week in Germany on bringing a lasting peace to the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region , a diplomatic source close to the talks said on Friday .

1514
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
The source , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said Azerbaijani presidential adviser Vafa Gulizade and his Armenian counterpart Zhirayr Liparityan met to discuss the disputed enclave on Wednesday and had now flown home .

1515
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
An uneasy ceasefire has prevailed in Nagorno-Karabakh , which represents around 20 percent of Azeri territory , since May 1994 after ethnic Armenians drove Azeris out of the region .

1516
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
The conflict , which began in 1988 , claimed over 10,000 lives .

1517
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
" The main subject ( of the talks ) was the search for a peaceful solution for Nagorno-Karabakh , " the source said .

1518
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
He declined to reveal any more details about the content of the talks or their exact location in Germany .

1519
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Azerbaijan has said it is prepared to grant autonomy to Nagorno-Karabakh if Armenian forces pull out , but will not accept Armenia 's demands for the independence of the enclave .

1520
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Russia 's Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday the officials had departed for negotiations in Germany , adding that face-to-face talks between the two sides first took place last December in Amsterdam .

1521
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Interfax said the discussions were being held in parallel with peace talks mediated by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) and the broad-based Minsk Group of countries led by Russia and Finland .

1525
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
The windblown , chilly streets of this tiny Arctic town are all but deserted and flags are flying at half-mast beneath a brooding , clouded sky .

1526
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Longyear is a town in mourning , a close-knit community that has been shattered .

1527
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Disaster struck on Thursday when a Russian airliner bringing coal miners to work crashed as it came in to land at the airport , killing all 141 people on board .

1528
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
" It 's a sight I will never forget .

1529
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I will remember it for the rest of my life , " said Stig Onarheim .

1530
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
He was one of a handful of rescuers who raced to the scene of the crash in a helicopter on Thursday , hoping in vain to find survivors .

1531
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
The plane smashed into a snow-capped mountain on the Arctic island of Spitzbergen on Thursday , just east of Longyear .

1532
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
" Imagine a big plane with a lot of luggage and people on board .

1533
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Think of all that mixed together , with twisted , wrecked parts on the slope , " Onarheim , 29 , told Reuters .

1534
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Police and local officials have sealed off the crash site , protecting it from intrusive reporters and from the polar bears that roam freely across the icy expanses .

1535
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
The dead were all Russians and Ukrainians , coming to work in the mining towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden .

1536
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Longyear is a Norwegian settlement of just over 1,000 people , but it also feels the loss keenly .

1537
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
" I have trouble finding the words to express my grief .

1538
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It 's a tragedy for everyone .

1539
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
We know many of the people who live in Barentsburg , some of them could have been on the plane , " said Johan Sletten , 52 .

1540
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Sletten , a caretaker who has lived on the island for 30 years , said the Norwegian and Russian communities visit frequently , competing at soccer in the summer and with snow-scooter races in the winter .

1541
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Teenage shop assistant Heidi Groenstein was blunter .

1542
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
" I 'm glad it was not a Norwegian plane , " she said . "

1543
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Just think of it -- a mining village where so many workers die .

1544
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
They must be having a tough time of it now . "

1545
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Barentsburg , just a few hours ride by snow-scooter or 15 minutes by helicopter from Longyear , has asked to be left alone with its grief and told reporters to stay away .

1546
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Around 100 Russian and Ukrainian miners were waiting in Longyear to fly home on the plane that crashed .

1547
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
They were given shelter in the town 's church overnight and ate a sombre breakfast before getting on a bus for the airport .

1548
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Another plane had been sent from Moscow to pick them up .

1549
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
At this time of year , the only colour in Longyear comes from the brightly-painted wooden houses .

1550
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Everything else is muddy , the waters of the fjord leaden .

Winter is in the air .

Barentsburg is an even grimmer place , a run-down testament to the hardships of the new Russia .

1553
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Spitzbergen lies some 500 miles ( 800 km ) off the northern tip of Norway and endures one of the most extreme climates on the planet .

1554
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Inhabited by fewer than 3,000 people in total , it sees the sun for 24 hours a day during summer and is plunged into round-the-clock darkness in the winter months .

1555
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
The terrain is mountainous , the only roads are dirt tracks .

1556
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Norway rules the island group under the terms of a 1920s international treaty which gave many other nations the right to establish setttlements and exploit the coal that is still mined there .

Hong Kong also had the necessary " constitutional infrastructure " in place , with the promise of autonomy in running its affairs after the handover from Britain to China .

1570
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
" What this means in practice is that Hong Kong will go on raising its own taxes , issuing its own currency , setting its own expenditure priorities and managing its own enormous financial reserves , " Tsang said .

1571
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
He acknowledged that many Hong Kong people had decided to seek their future elsewhere and others were sure to follow in the next nine months . "

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
The Palestinian letter from Marwan Jilani said the destruction of the Jerusalem centre was an effort by Israel to " alter the character , demographic composition and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem " and violated agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation .

1644
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
" This most recent measure represents a revival of old , malicious plans to confiscate the land and build units for Israeli settlers within the walls of the Old City . "

1645
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
" We expect the international community to take a clear and firm position , based on international law and in accordance with U.N. resolutions , against all such Israeli violations and illegal practices , " he said .

1646
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
On Tuesday , Israeli crews hoisted a bulldozer over the walls of Jerusalem 's old city and demolished the centre , saying it was being restored without a building permit .

1647
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Canada had recently donated $ 30 million to the centre , called the Burj al-Laqlaq Society .

SOCCER - REAL SCRAPE 1-1 DRAW IN SCRAPPY OPENING MATCH .

1649
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
LA CORUNA , Spain 1996-08-31

1650
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
A late goal by newly-signed defender Roberto Carlos saved the blushes of Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello and his multi-billion peseta line-up in the opening game of the Spanish championship on Saturday .

1651
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
The Brazilian 's 79th-minute effort was enough to earn Real a point from a scrappy 1-1 draw at fellow title contenders Deportivo Coruna .

1652
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Deportivo started strongly , taking the lead midway through the first half when former Auxerre playmaker Corentine Martins headed home a corner after a flick-on by Brazilian-born Spanish international midfielder Donato .

1653
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Real looked to be in deep trouble shortly after the break when Luis Milla was sent off for committing two bookable offences in as many minutes .

1654
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But Deportivo were unable to capitalise on their numerical advantage , and were themselves reduced to ten men when Armando Alvarez was sent off 15 minutes from time .

1655
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Shortly afterwards Roberto Carlos found space in the home defence and equalised for Real with a shot that was deflected past despairing Deportivo ' keeper Jacques Songo'o .

1656
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
In a frantic final five minutes there were chances at both ends , and Donato , who had earlier been booked , was sent off for protesting about the incursion of Real players at a free kick .

1657
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Before the match Deportivo chairman Augusto Lendoiro said he would ignore a FIFA decision banning Brazilian midfielder Mauro Silva from playing in the match for failing to join his national side 's tour of Europe .

1658
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
In the event , coach John Toshack decided not to use Silva , who had claimed he did not join the Brazil squad because he had lost his passport .

ESCHEN , Liechtenstein 1996-08-31

1670
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
The Republic of Ireland 's new-look side dispelled painful memories of their last visit to Liechtenstein by beating the Alpine part-timers 5-0 in a World Cup qualifier on Saturday .

1671
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
The Irish , under new manager Mick McCarthy , took a 4-0 lead within 20 minutes through captain Andy Townsend , 20-year-old Norwich striker Keith O'Neill , Sunderland forward Niall Quinn and teenager Ian Harte .

1672
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Quinn added his second and Ireland 's fifth just after the hour to complete the rout and give the Irish their biggest-ever away win .

1673
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
The result helped erase memories of Ireland 's visit to the Eschen stadium 14 months ago , when Jack Charlton 's side were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw which ultimately cost them a place in the European championship finals .

1874
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Essex need another 148 with five wickets in hand to beat Yorkshire after a maiden first-class century from Richard Kettleborough transformed a match which his side had seemed certain to lose .

1875
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Kent will also need to keep their nerve against struggling Nottinghamshire who will enter the final day 137 ahead with four wickets left in a relatively low-scoring match at Tunbridge Wells .

1876
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Derbyshire , nine-wicket winners over Worcestershire , and Surrey , who thrashed Warwickshire by an innings and 164 runs , can instead take the day off along with rivals Leicestershire , who beat Somerset inside two days .

1877
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Warwickshire captain Tim Munton is tipping Surrey to emerge on top , impressed by the positive influence of Australian coach Dave Gilbert , but Derbyshire 's Australian captain Dean Jones is conceding nothing as his side chase their first title for 60 years .

1878
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
" We took three absolutely brilliant catches in this match and our catching all season has been pretty impressive .

LONDON 1996-08-31

1939
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Former Wallaby captain Michael Lynagh began his career in English club rugby in impeccable fashion on Saturday to frustrate his old coach Bob Dwyer on his league coaching debut with Leicester .

1940
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Lynagh kicked five penalties and a conversion from his six attempts at goal to steer his multi-national Saracens side to a 25-23 home win and offer millionaire backer Nigel Wray an early return on his big investment in the north London club .

1941
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
French centre Philippe Sella also enjoyed a good game alongside Lynagh , although the home team scored only one try through England scrum-half Kyran Bracken .

1942
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
The new French connection at Harlequins also made a good start , Laurent Cabannes and Laurent Benezech scoring a try apiece in their side 's 75-19 victory over Gloucester .

1943
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Former England captain Will Carling , handed the kicking duties , finished with 20 points .

1944
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
With the first day of the league season briefly shifting the spotlight away from the discord between the clubs and the Rugby Football Union , there were also emphatic victories for champions Bath , 56-13 winners over Orrell , and Northampton and narrow successes for Wasps and Bristol .

JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-31

2170
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
South Africa managed to avoid a fifth successive defeat in 1996 at the hands of the All Blacks with an emphatic 32-22 victory in front of an ecstatic Ellis Park crowd on Saturday .

2171
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
They scored three tries in recording their highest total against New Zealand , salvaging some pride in a season in which the world champions have lost five out of eight tests .

2172
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It also ended a run of nine successive victories this year for New Zealand but arrived too late to prevent a 2-1 series defeat and an historic first All Black series triumph on South African soil .

2173
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Springbok scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen was his side 's inspiration , scoring their opening try and making the third for flanker Andre Venter from a quickly taken penalty to give his side a 29-8 lead after 54 minutes .

2174
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Fullback Andre Joubert scored the other , scorching in from 40 metres at the start of the second half to add to his three long-range penalties .

2175
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
The All Blacks salvaged some pride by scoring two tries from centre Walter Little and scrum-half Justin Marshall in the final five minutes to close a gap which at one point stood at 24 points .

2176
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But they generally endured an off-day , highlighted by recalled fly-half Andrew Mehrtens who missed five out of eight kicks at goal .

2177
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Recalled fly-half Henry Honiball kicked the Springboks into a 6-0 lead after 10 minutes only to see Andrew Mehrtens launch a penalty from eight metres inside his own half to narrow the gap .

2178
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Mehrtens missed three further penalties and a conversion in the first 40 minutes which could have put his side ahead , but it was the Springboks who looked the more dangerous .

2179
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Their promise was realised when Joubert made a 40-metre break in the 25th minute and , although winger Pieter Hendriks appeared to knock on Joubert 's reverse pass , Welsh referee Derek Bevan allowed Van der Westhuizen to pick up and score under the posts .

2180
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Honiball converted and Joubert kicked a penalty before All Black hooker Sean Fitzpatrick scored a try from close range on the stroke of half-time to narrow the lead to 16-8 and hint at a comeback .

2181
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Instead Joubert kicked another long penalty and then raced around the outside of the defence to score the Springboks ' second try .

2182
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
A quick penalty from Van der Westhuizen five metres from the All Black line set up the third try for Venter five minutes later and when Joubert kicked his third penalty the Springboks held an unassailable 32-8 lead going into the last quarter .

2183
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
When the All Blacks did break through , it was too late .

2184
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Centre Walter Little followed up Mehrtens ' kick to score under the posts and scrum-half Justin Marshall forced himself over from a ruck close to the line in injury-time to give them some consolation .

2185

2254
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
England 's irrepressible midfielder Paul Gascoigne was up to his old tricks on Saturday , pulling down his team mate Paul Ince 's trousers in front of an astonished crowd in Moldova .

2255
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Ince was clambering over a wall at the Republican stadium in Chisinau as Glenn Hoddle 's England players tried to escape heavy rain during an under-21 clash .

Gascoigne , whose compulsive practical joking has landed him in trouble in the past , tugged down the Inter Milan player 's trousers in front of a group of press photographers .

SQUASH - HILL BRANDS WORLD CHAMPION JANSHER A CHEAT .

2310
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
HONG KONG 1996-08-31

2311
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Controversial Australian Anthony Hill called Jansher Khan a cheat during his acrimonious defeat by the world number one in the Hong Kong Open semifinals on Saturday .

2312
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
The match boiled over when Hill made to walk off court after what he claimed was a game-winning point in the third .

2313
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
When the referee called Jansher 's return good and the decision was accepted by the player , Hill shrieked at the Pakistani : " You cheat . "

2314
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
" He was standing right there and knew the shot was down so I called him a cheat , " said Hill , whose squash career has been blighted by fines and suspensions for unacceptable behaviour .

2315
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
" He knew it was down and accepted what I called him because of that . "

2316
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Hill won the game on the next point and said later that Jansher was generally honest on court but played by the referee 's decision .

2317
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
The Australian had upset Jansher 's rhythm with his mixture of gamesmanship and fluent stroke-making but eventually succumbed 15-7 17-15 14-15 15-8 .

2318
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
" I changed my strategy against him today and had him rattled , " he added .

2319
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
He is not as fit as he used to be be but was too good for me in the end .

2320
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I shook him a bit but he will come out next time and be a better player for it -- that 's Jansher . "

2321
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Jansher said that he was disturbed to be called a cheat . "

2322
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
What he did was bad for squash , bad for the crowd and bad for the sponsors .

2323
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
" We are trying to build up squash like tennis and players should not say things like that .

2324
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
" I think the Professional Squash Association should look into this matter and deal with it properly .

2325
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I am not calling for him to be banned but they have to take some action . "

2326
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Jansher , bidding for an eighth Hong Kong Open title , plays second-seeded Australian Rodney Eyles in the final .

2327
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Eyles played his best squash of the tournament to beat fourth-seeded Peter Nicol of Scotland 15-10 8-15 15-10 15-4 .

2328
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Eyles , who defeated Jansher in the semifinals of the Portuguese Open in 1993 , said that he would like to win for the good of the game .

2329
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
" I have nothing against Jansher but it will be great if I could beat him , " said Eyles . "

2330
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
My biggest problem against Jansher is concentration .

2331
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I want to beat him so badly that I just cannot get it together . "

2336
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
MILWAUKEE , Wisconsin 1996-08-31

2337
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Jesper Parnevik of Sweden fired a course record-tying eight-under-par 63 Saturday to take a one-shot lead into the final round of the $ 1.2 million Greater Milwaukee Open .

2338
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Parnevik , who is seeking his first PGA Tour victory , moved to 19-under 194 for the tournament .

2339
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Parnevik tied the 18-hole record set by Loren Roberts in 1994 at the Brown Deer Park Golf Course and also equalled Saturday by Greg Kraft .

2340
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Nolan Henke , who led by two strokes entering the third round , carded a four-under 67 and was one stroke back at 18-under 195 .

2341
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
He is striving for his fourth career PGA Tour victory and first since the 1993 BellSouth Classic .

2342
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Tiger Woods , who made the cut in his first tournament as a professional , shot a two-over-par 73 and was four under for the tournament .

2343
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
The 20-year-old Woods , who turned professional Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive U.S. Amateur Championship , struggled on the front nine , bogeying the first and seventh holes and double-bogeying the par-four , 359-yard ninth hole .

2344
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
After bogeying the 10th hole to move to four-over for the round , he rallied for birdies on 15 and 18 .

2345
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
After Parnevik started off his round by parring the first hole and bogeying the second , the Swede birdied six of the next seven holes .

2346
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Parnevik continued to storm through the course , birdying three holes on the back nine , including two from 12 feet out on the 15th and 17th holes .

2347
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
" I ca n't remember when I 've putted this well , " said Parnevik . "

2348
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I was disappointed when a 12-footer did n't go in .

2349
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
" My game feels very good .

2350
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I 've been fading my driver but today whenever I set up for a fade it went straight .

2351
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Whenever everyone 's making birdies , you never want to be even par . "

2352
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Henke had a bogey-free round and birdied four holes , including a 45-footer on the par-three 215-yard seventh hole and one from 12 feet out on the 12th hole .

2353
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
" I did n't hit it very well today , " said Henke . "

2354
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Jasper blew right by me .

2355
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Once he did , I knew I had to make birdies just to keep up .

2356
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I made some really good pars .

2357
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I basically picked up where I left off yesterday afternoon .

2358
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
" Right now , I ca n't put my finger on what 's wrong . "

2359
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Bob Estes shot a 67 for sole possession of third place at 15-under .

2360
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Steve Stricker , who tied for second at last week 's World Series of Golf , and Stuart Appleby were both five shots off the lead at 14 under .

2361
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Duffy Waldorf , who also tied for second at the World Series of Golf , carded a 70 to lead a group of six golfers at 13 under , including Kraft .

2362
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000

NEW YORK 1996-08-31

2366
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
This year 's Fed Cup finalists -- defending champion Spain and the United States -- will hit the road to open the 1997 women 's international team competition , based on the draw conducted Saturday at the U.S. Open .

2367
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Spain travels to Belgium , while the U.S. team heads to the Netherlands for first-round matches March 1-2 .

2368
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
The other two first-round ties will pit hosts Germany against the Czech Republic and visiting France against Japan .

2369
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
The semifinals are July 19-20 , and the final September 27- 28 .

2370
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Life on the road this year did not slow the Americans , who will try to avenge their 3-2 defeat in the final last year when they host Spain on September 28-29 in Atlantic City .

2371
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
" Last year we stood on the court after we had lost and we put out hands together and made it our committment to bring back the Cup , " U.S. captain Billie Jean King said at the draw . "

2372
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
That is our sole goal . "

2373
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
The United States edged Austria in Salzburg 3-2 in the opening round in April , and then blanked Japan 5-0 in Nagoya last month in the semifinals .

2374
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
The victory against Japan marked the Fed Cup debut of Monica Seles , who became a naturalised U.S. citizen in 1994 .

2375
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Seles easily won both her singles matches and King is counting on the co-world number one to lead the team again .

2376
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
" I told Monica we need her if we want to win , " King said .

2377
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Seles 's sore left shoulder and a wrist injury to Fed Cup veteran Mary Joe Fernandez have forced King to take a wait and see attitude regarding her squad for the best-of-five match .

2378
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Fernandez was forced to withdraw from the U.S. Open .

2379
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
" We will wait until the last minute so we check with everybody and their injuries , " said King . "

2380
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
What we like would be Seles , ( Olympic champion Lindsay ) Davenport and Mary Joe Fernandez . "

2381
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
If she can get that threesome together , King will feel good about her chances against the Spain 's formidable duo of Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez .

2382
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
" To be a great coach you have to have the right horses and I got the right horses , " said King .

BASEBALL - KEVIN BROWN LOWERS ERA AS MARLINS BEAT REDS .

2490
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
CINCINNATI 1996-08-31

2491
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Major league ERA leader Kevin Brown threw an eight-hitter and Devon White 's RBI double snapped a fifth-inning tie as the Florida Marlins beat the Cincinnati Reds 3-1 for their seventh straight win Friday .

2492
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Brown ( 14-10 ) tied Todd Stottlemyre of the Cardinals for the National League lead with his fifth complete game and lowered his major league-leading earned run average from 1.96 to 1.92 .

2493
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
He struck out eight and did not walk a batter .

2494
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Brown threw 119 pitches and won for the third time in as many starts against the Reds this season .

2495
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
" Bolesy ( Florida manager John Boles ) told me yesterday , ' You have to go nine tomorrow , ' " Brown said .

2496
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
" In the early innings , I was struggling , I was just trying to make it from pitch to pitch .

2497
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I gave up a lot of hits in the early innings and I was n't thinking about the seventh , eighth or ninth .

2498
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I was n't satisfied with any of my pitches and I did a better job of moving the ball around in the later innings . "

2499
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
" He has a devastating sinker , " observed Reds manager Ray Knight . "

2500
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
The guys say it moved more than everyone in the league .

2501
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I remember Nolan Ryan saying in ' 91 or ' 92 that he was the best young pitcher coming around in a long time and he saw ( Tom ) Seaver and ( Jerry ) Koosman when they were starting . "

2502
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
In Philadelphia , Delino DeShields 's triple in the top of the 12th off Jeff Parrett ( 2-3 ) scored Chad Curtis and lifted the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 7-6 victory over the Phillies .

2503
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Los Angeles won for the seventh time in eight games .

2504
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Darren Dreifort ( 1-1 ) picked up the win after allowing a hit and a walk over 2 1/3 scoreless innings .

2505
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Todd Worrell worked the 12th to earn his league-leading 37th save .

2506
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
The Phillies have dropped five of their last six overall , and nine of 11 at home .

2507
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Billy Ashley belted a three-run homer for Los Angeles .

2508
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
In Chicago , the Braves and Cubs split a doubleheader .

2509
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
In the first game , Ryne Sandberg snapped an eighth-inning tie with an infield single and Kevin Foster ( 6-2 ) outdueled Atlanta 's Tom Glavine ( 13-8 ) for his third straight win , 3-2 .

2510
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Foster , a .333 hitter , helped his own cause in the second with a two-run single .

2511
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
The Braves took the second game when Chipper Jones singled home the tying run in the top of the ninth and Andruw Jones took advantage of a poor throw to score the go-ahead run on a sacrifice fly for a 6-5 victory .

In New York , Marvin Benard 's two-run homer snapped a tie and Shawn Estes came one out away from his first complete game as the San Francisco Giants beat the Mets 6-4 .

2521
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Benard , hitting .467 ( 14-for-30 ) against the Mets this season , hit his first pitch from Pete Harnisch ( 8-10 ) in the seventh over the right-field fence to put the Giants up 4-2 .

2522
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Estes ( 3-4 ) was lifted for closer Rod Beck after yielding a single with two out in the ninth .

2523
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Beck allowed a two-run double to Alvaro Espinoza , who collected a career-high four RBI , but struck out Brent Mayne for his 31st save .

2524
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
The loss was the Mets ' eighth straight , their longest slide since September 1993 , and dropped them to 0-4 under new manager Bobby Valentine .

NEW YORK 1996-08-30

2536
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Refusing to go quietly in the night , Stefan Edberg extended his stay at his 14th and last U.S. Open when Bernd Karbacher , trailing and hurting , quit in the fourth set of their second-round match Friday .

2537
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
The 30-year-old Edberg , a former two-time Open champion , had wrestled control of the match away from Karbacher when the German , hampered by a left hamstring injury , decided he could n't continue under the stadium lights at the National Tennis Centre .

2538
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
" A win is a win .

2539
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I 'll take it , " Edberg , who has announced that this will be his last Grand Slam event , said of the 3-6 6-3 6-3 1-0 victory .

2540
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Ironically , Karbacher two years ago ended Ivan Lendl 's Grand Slam career here when the former champion had to retire in the middle of their first-round match .

2541
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
After seeing the trainer come out early in the third set , Edberg was not surprised by Karbacher 's decision not to go on .

2542
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
" I knew he had problems with something , " Edberg said . "

2543
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I really was n't surprised . "

2544
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Edberg had his own problems early in the match as the Swede battled to acclimate himself to the nighttime conditions while Karbacher was ripping passing shots and blasting serves past him .

2545
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
" I did n't really feel good to begin with , I had problems finding the timing on the ball , seeing the ball , " said Edberg , who upset Wimbledon champion and fifth-seeded Richard Krajicek in the first round .

2546
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
" This was one of these matches where I did n't play up to my standard .

2547
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I had to fight hard . "

2548
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Edberg 's tenacity paid off in the second set .

2549
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Edberg lost his own serve twice , but he rallied for three breaks of his own , the last to wrap up the set .

2550
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
" That 's where the match sort of changed , " said Edberg . "

2551
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I think once I got that second set , I felt a lot better about my game . "

2552
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Edberg is starting to feel pretty good about postponing his swan song a lot longer .

2553
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
" It does n't look all that bad , " Edberg said of his path through the draw starting next with a match against Krajicek 's Dutch countryman Paul Haarhuis .

2554
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
However , the 1991 and 1992 champion is not ready to start making plans to be in next week 's final .

2555
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
" I 'm always being realistic , " said Edberg . "

2556
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Like I said many times , I think it 's a very little chance , but nothing is impossible .

2557
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
If I play great tennis , that could take me a long way .

2558
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
" A lot of things can happen , like tonight . "

2559

2561

VIENNA 1996-08-31

2565
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Austria dominated their World Cup group four qualifier against Scotland on Saturday with wave after wave of attacks but were unable to penetrate the visitors ' defence and had to settle for a goalless draw .

2566
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Scotland , who thrashed Belarus 5-1 in their opening group four match , were unable to repeat their performance .

2567
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Austria 's best chance came in the 63rd minute with Stephan Marasek of SC Freiburg taking advantage of a scramble in the Scottish penalty area but his shot narrowly passing the left-hand post .

2568
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
They also went close a minute before the interval when a promising attack saw the ball fall to Markus Schopp but he hit his shot wide .

2569
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Everton 's Duncan Ferguson went close for Scotland in the 65th minute when he forced Austrian goalkeeper Michael Konsel to a diving save .

2570
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Two Scotland players were shown yellow cards , captain Gary McAllister for bringing down Andreas Heraf and Ferguson for arguing against the referee 's decision .

2571
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
" The result is acceptable , " Scottish coach Craig Brown told reporters . "

2572
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
We 'd hoped not to lose and we tried not to play for a draw but the Austrian defence was simply too good . "

2573
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
SK Rapid 's Dietmar Kuehbauer , who gave an impressive performance , said the team started off well but let the game slip after the first 30 minutes .

2574
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
" Somehow it seemed there were less than 11 players on the pitch .

2575
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
We have lost two points .

2576
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
The Scots are not really a great team and we should have won , " he said .

2577
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Austrian coach Herbert Prohaska said his team had displayed great fighting spirit but sometimes lacked ideas .

2578
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Teams :

2579
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Austria : Michael Konsel , Markus Schopp , Peter Schoettel , Anton Pfeffer , Wolfgang Feiersinger , Stephan Marasek , Dieter Ramusch ( Andreas Ogris 77th ) , Dietmar Kuehbauer , Anton Polster ( ( Herfried Sabitzer 68th ) , Andreas Herzog , Andreas Heraf .

2585
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
PARIS 1996-08-31

2586
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Euro 96 absentee Nicolas Ouedec and Youri Djorkaeff scored the goals as 1998 World Cup hosts France beat Mexico 2-0 in a friendly international on Saturday .

2587
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
The victory extended to 29 matches France 's unbeaten run under coach Aime Jacquet , their Euro 96 semifinal elimination having come in a penalty shoot-out , but was marred by the sending-off of Chelsea central defender Franck Leboeuf .

2588
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Leboeuf was dismissed two minutes from time for a second bookable offence , fouling Mexican substitute Ricardo Pelaez who minutes earlier had also been shown the yellow card for pushing the Chelsea defender in the back .

2589
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Both goals came early in the second half after France had surprised the Mexicans with three half-time substitutions .

2590
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
After a sterile first half , France injected more sting in midfield with the introduction of Juventus 's Zinedine Zidane .

2591
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
This allowed Djorkaeff to play further up and his cross from the right fell for Ouedec , who has joined Espanyol of Barcelona from Nantes since missing the European championship finals through injury , to score after a mistake by midfielder Joaquin del Olmo .

2592
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Within four minutes Ouedec was returning the compliment for Djorkaeff , playing a one-two with the Internazionale Milan forward down the middle to set him up for a cross shot past diving goalkeeper Osvaldo Sanchez .

2593
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Jacquet , beginning the 22-month countdown to France 's hosting of the World Cup finals , said : " We have an identity ( as a team ) which we are going to work on . "

2594
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000

BRUSSELS 1996-08-31

2605
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Belgium kicked off their 1998 World Cup campaign with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over 10-man Turkey in a tense match marred by Turkish crowd trouble shortly after the break .

2606
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Turkish fans , upset at their team 's 2-0 first-half deficit , ripped apart dozens of plastic seats and threw them over the fence .

2607
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Riot police took 10 minutes to restore order .

2608
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
The police were given an unexpected hand by second-half substitute Sergen Yalcin who rekindled Turkish hopes in the 61st with a splendid half-volley which stunned Belgian goalkeeper Filip De Wilde .

2609
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
But Yalcin , who had come on just four minutes earlier , turned from hero to villain barely two minutes after his strike when he was sent off after spitting at an opponent and arguing with English referee David Elleray .

2610
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Marc Degryse had opened the scoring for Belgium after 13 minutes , whacking a low 10-metre drive into the net after an incisive pass by defender Dirk Medved from the edge of the penalty area .

2611
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Brazilian-born Luis Oliveira then gleefully slipped the ball past goalkeeper Rustu Recber from the right of the area to make it 2-0 seven minutes before the interval , Turkey 's best first-half effort proving to be a vicious 30-metre shot by Ogun Temizkanoglu which De Wilde tipped over .

2612
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
The visitors , seeking to restore some pride after failing to score a single goal in Euro 96 in June , repeatedly ripped through the left side of the home defence but De Wilde was able to block several sharply-angled efforts .

2613
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
With only the group seven winners qualifying automatically for the 1998 finals in France , Belgium could not afford a slip-up at home and they frantically chased a decisive third goal .

2614
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
But they were almost upset 12 minutes from time when De Wilde fumbled a hard Arif Erdem shot and Orhan Cikirikci almost pounced on the loose ball .

2615
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Belgium 's best second-half effort came three minutes later when Degryse put the ball over the bar from close range with Recber beaten .

2616
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Teams :

2617

2619
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Belgian coach Wilfried Van Moer said he had not expected Turkey to be so strong and fast .

2620
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
" We started panicking a bit after the Turkish goal ...

2621
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
we suffered , " said Van Moer , who succeeded Paul Van Himst as coach in April .

2622
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
It was Belgium 's first victory under Van Moer after two draws in friendlies against Russia and Italy .

2777
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Seven Iraqi men appeared in court on Saturday charged with air piracy following the hijacking to Britain of a Sudanese airliner with 199 people aboard .

2778
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
The seven , including a carpenter and a businessmen and whose ages ranged from 25 to 38 years old , were ordered to be held in jail until another hearing next week .

2779
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
No pleas were entered at the preliminary hearing .

2780
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
They were accused of taking over Flight 150 which was flying from Khartoum , Sudan , to Amman , Jordan .

2781
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
All the hostages were freed on Tuesday after the plane landed at Stansted airport , north of London .

2782
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
The men have claimed political asylum in Britain saying they were persecuted while in Iraq .

2783
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Their court appearance means they will face trial and possible imprisonment in Britain before their applications for asylum are considered .

2784
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Under English law the maximum sentence for hijack is life imprisonment but there has been widespread speculation that the seven will receive lesser sentences .

2785
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
After a search of the aircraft following the hijack , police found only knives and fake explosives .

00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
An Iraqi opposition group in exile said on Saturday it had received reports that Iraqi forces were shelling and advancing on the Kurdish town of Arbil in northern Iraq .

2789
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
A London-based spokesman of the Iraqi National Congress said Iraqi artillery was shelling the city and Iraqi tanks had advanced to within 10 km ( six miles ) of Arbil , the administrative centre of the Kurdish rebel-controlled region of northern Iraq .

2790
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
" At 4.50 a.m. Iraq time ( 0050 GMT ) Iraqi forces began an artillery attack on the outskirts of Arbil , " the spokesman , who asked not to be identified , told Reuters in a telephone call .

2791
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
There was no independent confirmation of the report which the spokesman said came from the organisation 's members in Arbil .

2792
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
He said damage and casualties in the city were heavy and Kurdish forces were defending the city .

President Bill Clinton on Friday ordered the U.S. military to ready itself for any possible action as Washington turned up the heat in an escalating crisis over Iraqi troop movements in northern Iraq .

2794
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
On Thursday , Iraq accused Iran of aggression and said it reserved the right to retaliate for Tehran 's alleged deployment of troops into northern Iraq , where fighting broke out between the two main Iraqi Kurdish rebel groups two weeks ago .

2798
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
The report , monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) , quoted security services as saying six other people were injured in the blast in the town of Staouelli .

2799
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000

CAPE TOWN 1996-08-31

2817
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
South African right-wing Afrikaners on Saturday revived their campaign for a form of self-rule , identifying a sparsely-populated area in Northern Cape province as the best place for a home of their own .

2818
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Constand Viljoen , leader of the Freedom Front party , told a news conference in Pretoria self-determination for Afrikaners could begin at local government level .

2819
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
" Certain powers can be delegated from the provincial level , towards the sub-regions , " he said .

2820
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
" We think that the Afrikaner model within this new , multi- ethnic society of South Africa will have to develop experimentally with world thinking in this regard . "

2821
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Viljoen broke with other right-wing whites in 1994 by taking part in the country 's first all-race elections in April of that year , saying the only way to attain self-determination was by cooperating with President Nelson Mandela 's majority African National Congress .

2822
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Some right-wingers demanded sovereignty in their own territory in the run-up to the elections , saying the alternative was war .

2823
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Their threats came to nothing .

2824
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Viljoen has hailed clauses in South Africa 's new constitution as making possible a form of self-rule for the Afrikaners , descendants of the country 's Dutch , German and French settlers .

2825
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
According to state television , Viljoen told the news conference the self-rule model should be introduced in parts of the Northern Cape provinces where a majority of people -- whites and mixed-race Coloureds -- speak Afrikaans .

Rwandan refugee group calls for calm over census .

NAIROBI 1996-08-31

2828
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
A Rwandan refugee lobby group called on Saturday for calm in refugee camps in eastern Zaire during a census from Sunday to be conducted by aid workers .

2829
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
The Rally for the Return of Refugees and Democracy in Rwanda ( RDR ) urged the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to avoid any " policing approach " and to calm refugees by explaining the aims of the operation .

2830
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
" The RDR appeals to all refugees to prepare themselves calmly for the demands of the census agents because it will be in their ultimate interest , " the group said in a statement .

2831
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
It said refugees feared census takers would use indelible ink to mark them so they could be detected by Rwandan government troops and mistreated if they were forced back into Rwanda .

2832
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
U.N. officials said more than 1,000 aid workers will take part in the census from Sunday until Tuesday of the estimated 727,000 refugees in camps around the eastern Zairean border town of Goma .

2833
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Only about 100 refugees a week are returning voluntarily to Rwanda in contrast to the 600 babies born in the camps weekly .

2834
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo said at the end of a visit to Rwanda last week that the Zairean and Rwandan governments agreed on an " organised , massive and unconditional repatriation " of the 1.1 million Rwandan refugees in Zaire .

2835
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
He said the repatriation would be carried out swiftly and would be enormous , starting with the closure of refugee camps .

2836
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
RDR said it feared forced expulsions would start in days .

2837
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Zairean troops expelled 15,000 refugees in August last year .

2838
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Many of the 1.1 million Rwandan Hutu refugees in Zaire and nearly 600,000 in Tanzania refuse to go home , saying they fear reprisals for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda of up to a million people by Hutus .

MAHALA , Bosnia 1996-08-31

2841
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
NATO said it was closely monitoring the movement of about 75 Moslem men towards the village of Mahala in Bosnia 's Serb republic on Saturday , two days after a violent confrontation with Serbs .

2842
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
" I have to report this morning that we have in fact received reports ...

2843
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
that up to 75 Moslem men are believed to be approaching Mahala , " NATO spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Max Marriner said in Sarajevo .

2844
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Marriner said that NATO troops had set up a checkpoint on the road between Tuzla and Mahala to establish the identities and intentions of the men headed towards the village .

2845
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Mahala is a Moslem village on Bosnian Serb republic territory .

2846
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Moslems were driven from the village during the 43- month Bosnian war and most of their houses were destroyed .

2847
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Some Moslems began returning to rebuild their properties earlier in the week .

2848
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Fights and shooting broke out between the Moslems and Serb police on Thursday and NATO troops finally brought restored order .

2849
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
A Reuters reporter who entered Mahala on Saturday morning found it tranquil but NATO troops and U.N. police were seen on the ground and NATO helicopters flew overhead .

2853
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Crowds of pro-independence Chechens greeted a newly-signed peace deal by singing , dancing and firing guns in the air on Saturday , but the celebrations held a trace of uncertainty .

2854
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
More than a thousand women , children and men gathered in a field to the north of the town of Urus-Martan on Saturday to wait for a column of rebels to withdraw from the capital Grozny about 25 km ( 12 miles ) away .

2855
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
The men fired weapons into the air as groups of women danced .

2856
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Adults in the crowd carried posters of former Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev -- who declared independence in 1991 -- and children , carrying photographs of him , called " Troops out ! "

2857
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
.

2858
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Russian military officials have expressed fears that the rebels and their supporters will see the deal signed by Russian peace envoy Alexander Lebed in the early hours of Saturday as a military victory for the separatists .

2859
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
It involves the withdrawal of Russian troops sent to Chechnya in December 1994 to crush the separatists and a postponement of the issue at the heart of the conflict -- the status of the mainly-Moslem North Caucasus region .

2860
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
But the people in the crowd on Saturday , who had turned out in support of the rebels , did not seem sure that the war was over .

2861
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
" We hope for the best , that it really has ended so we can live in peace .

2862
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It 's our only dream , " said a 30-year-old woman , Mubatik Dagayeva .

2863
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Aiza Dudayeva , with her 10-year-old son beside her , shared the guarded optimism . "

2864
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
We really want the war to end , we hope and believe that our sons and brothers will win , " said Dudayeva , adding that she was from Urus-Martan .

2865
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Urus-Martan is a traditionally anti-separatist pocket in Chechnya and Moscow-backed leader Doku Zavgayev , who has been sidelined in the peace deal , has warned that it and places like it could become centres of civil war if Russian troops leave .

2866
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
But on Saturday the people gathered just outside the town seemed to be united in favour of the separatists .

2867
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Two columns of rebels appeared in jeeps and cars , firing their guns in the air , as the crowd rushed towards them .

2868
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Mouldi Mamatuyev , in his late 20 's , dressed in black and carrying a machine gun , was welcomed by his mother and sister .

2869
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
" Two sons have come back , " said his mother Nurbika Mamatuyeva . "

2870
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It 's the end .

2871
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
We believe in God . "

2872
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Mamatuyev joked that his sister Lisa was a rebel too , and she responded by grabbing hold of his gun and shouting the Chechen war cry " Allahu Akhbar " ( God is Greatest ) and " Freedom for Chechnya ! "

2873
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
.

2874
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
The fighter , sitting next to a man dressed in green and carrying a grenade-launcher , said that the strict Islamic law adopted by the rebels during the conflict was now needed to impose peace .

2875
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
" The war has ended if everything works out , if there is law there will be power .

2876
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Only Sheriat ( Islamic law ) can end the war . "

2879
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
A Polish consortium including the Bank Rozwoju Exportu SA ( BRE ) plans to rival France 's Hachette in bidding for Polish state-owned press distribution chain Ruch SA , Zycie Warszawy daily said on Saturday .

2880
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Zycie Warszawy said its own publisher , mineral water firm Multico , and a group headed by Polish businessman Zygmunt Solorz were forming a consortium which would offer about $ 120 million , with finance provided by BRE .

2881
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
The consortium wanted 40 percent of Ruch 's shares , the state would get 20 percent of Ruch and 40 percent would be offered on the Warsaw stock exchange .

2882
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
" This division would guarantee a dispersal of capital , preventing anyone from taking total control over Ruch and dictating market conditions , " the paper quoted one of the initiators of the move as saying , without giving a name .

2883
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
A consortium of press distributor Hachette and Polish publishers group UWP are seeking more than than 50 percent of Ruch and French President Jacques Chirac is likely to support its case when he visits Poland in September , the daily said .

2884
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
News-stand chain Ruch , which controls about 65 percent of Poland 's press distribution market , had a net profit of 16.2 million zlotys on sales of 2.7 billion zlotys in 1995 .

2885
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
It has about 17,000 news-stands and was the country 's sole press distributor before the 1989 fall of communism .

2886
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Zycie Warszawy said the new , open consortium , which also included several listed Polish firms , would on Monday inform Privatisation Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek of its plans .

2887
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
It aims to invest $ 200 million in Ruch over five years -- more than the sum Ruch says it needs to upgrade its outlets .

2888
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Initially Poland offered up to 75 percent of Ruch but in March Kaczmarek cancelled the tender and offered a minority stake with an option to increase the equity .

2889
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Two consortia -- UWP-Hachette and a consortium of a Polish SPC group and Swiss firms -- placed initial bids .

2890
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
But after the change of tender conditions Swiss investors pulled out and SPC decided to bid jointly with UWP-Hachette .

2891
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Kaczmarek said in May he was unhappy that only one investor ended up bidding for Ruch , in which the government was initially offering up to 35 percent of shares with an option to extend the holding after investment promises are fulfilled .

Three Russian servicemen were killed on Saturday when unidentified gunmen attacked guards at an anti-aircraft installation outside Moscow , Interfax news agency said .

2896
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
It quoted military officials as saying the attack took place in Sergiyev Posad 70 km ( 45 miles ) from the capital .

2897
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
The officials said the attackers had seized two Kalashnikov assault rifles and disappeared .

2898
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Attacks on servicemen aimed at seizing their guns have become frequent in Russia where the number of violent crimes committed with the use of fire arms is growing .

00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Puig 's first novel , " Bertillon 166 , " was published in 1960 , a year after the Cuban revolution brought President Fidel Castro to power .

2903
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
The book , which has been translated into 40 languages , deals with a day in the life of Santiago de Cuba , Puig 's native city , under the pre-Castro government of Fulgencio Batista .

2904
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
The titles of his other novels translate as " In the Year of January " ( 1963 ) , " The Collapse " ( 1964 ) , " Sleeping Bread " ( 1975 ) , " The Decaying Mansion " ( 1977 ) and " A World of Things " ( 1982 ) , followed by " The Knot , " " Soul Alone " and , most recently , " A Woman . "

2905
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Granma called " Sleeping Bread " Puig 's " greatest gift to the modern novel in our America . "

2906
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
The author said in an interview shortly before his death that his own experiences had lent his books their strong sense of realism . "

2907
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I 'm a thief of ideas , " he said . "

2908
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
The stories have been given to me by people . "

2909
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
In the same interview , published by Prensa Latina on Saturday , Puig was asked if he feared death . "

2910
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Death is not a punishment -- death is the end of life 's punishment , " he said .

Albright will meet Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza Monday for talks on issues currently up for debate on the council , of which Chile is a non-permanent member , a U.S. embassy statement said .

2915
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
The two will also discuss various issues affecting relations between the United States and Chile , local officials said .

2916
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000

Mexican army attacked in Michoacan state - report .

2920

MEXICO CITY 1996-08-30

2921
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
A group of heavily-armed men attacked a military convoy in the western Mexican state of Michoacan on Friday , killing one soldier and wounding two , radio reports said .

2922
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Radio Red quoted local police in the town of Tacambaro , Michoacan , 80 km ( 50 miles ) south of the state capital Morelia , as saying 40 to 50 armed men attacked the convoy .

2923
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Gonzalo Montoya , a police commander in Tacambaro , told Radio Red the group was armed with AK-47s and other high-powered assault rifles and wore military-style fatigues .

2924
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Montoya said he thought the attackers were criminals linked to drug trafficking or kidnapping in the area . "

2925
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
We often see people dressed in military-style clothing here , " he said .

2926
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
The attack comes a day after rebels of the self-styled Popular Revolutionary Army ( EPR ) launched coordinated attacks in at least three Mexican states , killing up to 14 people and wounding about 20 .

2927
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
China said to fear dissidents more than criminals .

MANILA 1996-08-31

2929
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
The detention of veteran dissident Wang Donghai showed China 's determination to crush any vestige of dissent during the current profound transitions in the nation 's leadership , a human rights activist said on Saturday .

2930
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Xiao Qiang , executive director of the New York-based group Human Rights in China , said Wang 's arrest on Friday appeared to be part of the national " Strike Hard " campaign that has imprisoned thousands and sent hundreds to their death .

2931
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Although supposedly aimed at criminals , dozens of human rights activists have been detained in the campaign , which is meant to strengthen the Communist Party 's grip on power as senior leader Deng Xiaoping nears death , Xiao said in an interview .

2932
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
" China is going through this power transition period .

2933
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
The authorities are apparently extremely afraid of any political and social discontent , " said Xiao , in Manila to attend an Amnesty International conference on human rights in China .

2934
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
He said one of Wang 's apparent offences was to write a public letter in May suggesting that a free press and an independent judicial system were vital if the government really meant to stamp out rampant corruption .

2935
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Xiao said crushing legitimate dissent was only making the problem worse and one day China would pay a high price .

2936
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
" Those issues are not going to go away by repression .

2937
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
You only make things more hidden but potentially more explosive , " he said .

2938
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Wang was arrested in the east China city of Hangzhou by security officers who told the dissident 's family he would be sent to a study class -- a euphemism for coercive ideological reform .

2939
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Wang , 45 , was sentenced last month to one year 's " re-education by labour " but was released because of ill-health .

2940
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Xiao said conditions in the labour camp were so brutal they drove another activist sentenced with Wang to attempt suicide .

2941
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Police beat Wang and his colleague , Chen Longde , and encouraged other camp inmates to attack them as well , Xiao said .

2944
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Philippine president Fidel Ramos expressed gratitude to Indonesian president Suharto and the Organisation of Islamic Conference ( OIC ) on Saturday for supporting talks that ended a conflict with local Moslem rebels .

2945
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
" I extend the deepest gratitude ... to your excellency for your untiring and invaluable friendship and support , " Ramos told Suharto in a letter .

2946
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
The full text of the letter was released to reporters on Saturday .

2947
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Jakarta served as the host to the series of negotiations which culminated in the initialling of the agreement last Friday .

2948
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
The formal signing of the peace agreement is scheduled on Monday in Manila .

2949
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Ramos said the peace agreement " shall bring down the curtain on a long and storied era of strife in Philippine history . "

2950
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000

RANGOON 1996-08-31

2954
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Burma 's democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi hit out at the government on Saturday for recent arrests and jailing of activists , saying the military abused the law to try to crush the democracy movement .

2955
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
" The main purpose of this press conference is to make it known to the world that the authorities are misusing the law all the time in order to try to crush the democracy movement , " Suu Kyi told reporters at her Rangoon home .

2956
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Suu Kyi said at least 61 democracy supporters had been arrested since May , and about 30 of them had been sentenced , most to long prison terms .

2957
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
In May the government launched a sweeping crackdown on the democracy movement , detaining over 260 members of Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy ( NLD ) ahead of a party congress .

2958
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Most were released but several dozen remain in custody .

2959
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
The Burmese government last week confirmed the recent sentencing of nine democracy activists who were arrested in the May crackdown , including Suu Kyi 's assistant Win Htein .

2960
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
The military government , which in May said it had detained the politicians to prevent anarchy , said the activists were charged with attempting to destroy the peace and stability of the state .

2961
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
But Suu Kyi disagreed with the methods , saying officials often arrested NLD supporters in the middle of the night , then did not give them the opportunity to defend themselves in trials .

2962
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
" When our people are tried , they are tried in a very secretive way .

2963
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Their families are not told , " she said .

2964
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Suu Kyi , who spearheads a campaign for sanctions on Burma 's government , was under house arrest for six years without being tried before being released in July 1995 .

2965
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Several other leading members of the NLD have served prison terms .

2966
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
The NLD party won a landslide victory in a 1990 election but the State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) , which assumed power in 1988 after crushing pro-democracy demonstrations , never recognised the poll .

2967
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
" This lack of rule of law is an indication that the authorities are not interested in fair play , " she said . "

2968
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
They are using a travesty of the law to try and crush our movements and to sentence our people to long terms in prison without proper trial . "

2969
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Suu Kyi said once the activists were sentenced , they suffered inhuman conditions and lack of rights in prison .

2970
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
" Almost all of the prisoners start suffering from various health problems after a couple of years in jail , " she said . "

2971
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Some of our people have been in prison for five to six years . "

2972
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Most political prisoners are held in Rangoon 's Insein Prison .

2973
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Some who have been released have recounted torture methods like sleep and food deprivation and physical abuse .

2974
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
" If there are any more instances of death in custody it will be further proof that a prison sentence for political prisoners is sometimes almost the same as a death sentence , " Suu Kyi said .

2975
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Hla Than , an elected member of parliament for the NLD , died in early August after being at Insein for six years .

2976
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
His death came five weeks after James Leander ( Leo ) Nichols , a close friend of Suu Kyi and Danish honorary consul , died while serving a prison term at Insein .

2977
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Suu Kyi said the government had increased its repression tactics on the democracy movement because it feared the growing popularity of the movement .

2978
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
But she said she and the NLD would not stop their efforts to bring democracy to Burma even if it meant more arrests of party members or even herself .

2979
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
" We will carry on .

2980
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Nobody is free from arrest in Burma . "

2988
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Multinational firms including Mobil , Shell and Caltex , were also attracted to Tianjin due to China 's rising demand for lube and oil-based products , the newspaper said .

2989
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It gave no further details .

2992
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
North Korea demanded on Saturday that South Korea return a northern war veteran who has been in the South since the 1950-53 war , Seoul 's unification ministry said .

2993
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
" ...I request the immediate repatriation of Kim In-so to North Korea where his family is waiting , " North Korean Red Cross president Li Song-ho said in a telephone message to his southern couterpart , Kang Young-hoon .

2994
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Li said Kim had been critically ill with a cerebral haemorrhage .

2995
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
The message was distributed to the press by the South Korean unification ministry .

2996
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Kim , an unrepentant communist , was captured during the Korean War and released after spending more than 30 years in a southern jail .

2997
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
He submitted a petition to the International Red Cross in 1993 asking for his repatriation .

2998
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
The domestic Yonhap news agency said the South Korean government would consider the northern demand only if the North accepted Seoul 's requests , which include regular reunions of families split by the Korean War .

2999
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Government officials were not available to comment .

3000

00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Chinese police have detained veteran dissident Wang Donghai , the New York-based pressure group Human Rights in China said on Saturday .

3004
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Police in Hangzhou , capital of the eastern province of Zhejiang , told Wang 's family that Wang would be sent to a study class , a euphemism for coercive ideological reform , the group said .

3005
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Police gave no reason for detaining Wang on Friday and would not let his family meet him or say where he was being held , the group said .

3006
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Police also would not say why Wang was being sent to a study class -- a holdover from the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution -- or say when he would be released , the group said .

3007
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Wang 's family and Hangzhou police could not be reached for immediate comment .

3008
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
The group demanded Wang 's release and said his detention was a dangerous signal China was returning to its Cultural Revolution days .

3009
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Last month , Wang , 45 , a veteran dissident of the 1979 Democracy Wall movement , was ordered to serve one year of " re-education through labour " , but released because of poor health .

3010
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Re-education through labour is an administrative punishment with a maximum of three years that can be imposed by police without recourse to prosecutors or the courts .

3011
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Wang was jailed for two years for organising street protests after the military crushed pro-democracy demonstrations by students at Beijing 's Tiananmen Square on June 4 , 1989 , with heavy loss of life .

3012
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Chinese authorities appeared to be using administrative punishment more frequently to take dissidents out of circulation without having to go through a more complicated judicial process to impose criminal sentences , Western diplomats have said .

The pressure group said Wang would be sent to a study class , often a euphemism in China for ideological reform .

3018
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Wang 's family could not immediately be reached for comment .

3024
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
An 88-year-old army veteran was jailed for 15 years by a Hong Kong court for drugs trafficking after he admitted he had stashed heroin under his mattress , a newspaper said on Saturday .

3025
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
" I am sorry to my ancestors for five generations , " Chen Chun-yeh told the High Court after sentencing on Friday , the Hong Kong Standard said . "

3026
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Tell my sons to collect my bones , " he said after hearing he was likely to die behind bars .

3027
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Chen , a former army secretary of the Chinese Nationalist regime which fled from mainland China to Taiwan in 1949 , pleaded guilty to trafficking 42 kg ( 92 pounds ) of drugs that could have been turned into 25 kg ( 55 pounds ) of heroin .

They have established a headquarters in Chuman , " Faik Nerweyi of the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) told Reuters by telephone from Ankara .

3045
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Nerweyi said he did not know the size or nature of the Iranian force in northern Iraq , but said KDP fighters had been easily outgunned in the area close to the Iranian border and had quickly withdrawn further west .

3046
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
" They were far too strong , " he said .

3047
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Nerweyi said he did not know if there were any casualties .

3048

00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
The monitoring committee was set up to deal with violations of an April 25 ceasefire understanding that ended 17 days of fighting between Israel and the guerrillas .

3061
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
The understandings forbid firing from or at civilian targest but do not rule out guerrilla attacks on Israeli troops and their local militia allies in south Lebanon .

" The leadership has decided to provide support and military aid to Mr Massoud Barzani and his comrades to enable them confront the vicious aggression ...

3079
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
from ( Patriotic Union of Kurdistan chief ) Jalal Talabani , " Aziz said in a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency ( INA ) .

3080
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Aziz said Iraq 's military intervention , the first on such scale since the U.S. and allies decided to protect Iraqi Kurds against Baghdad , was in response to a plea from Barzani to President Saddam Hussein to back him militarily and save his people from attacks by Iran and Talabani .

3081
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
He said Barzani sent a message to Saddam on August 22 in which he said : " The conspiracy is beyond our capability therefore we plead with your excellency to order Iraqi armed forces to interfere to help us to evade the foreign threat and put an end to Talabani 's treason and conspiracy . "

3082

3087
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000

3103
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Automakers , suppliers , insurers and the federal government 's auto safety agency Saturday launched a $ 10 million safety awareness campaign aimed at reducing the number of children killed accidentally by air bags in cars and trucks .

3104
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Officials said they will work with law enforcement agencies , pediatricians and media to warn parents about the dangers that air bags pose to children and adults not wearing seatbelts .

3105
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Since 1993 , 24 children have been killed by the explosive force of automotive air bags , which inflate at speeds up to 200 miles per hour .

3106
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
The first portion of the campaign involves pickup trucks equipped with billboards that were driving along some of the nation 's busiest interstate highways during the Labor Day weekend , including Interstate 95 on the East Coast , Interstates 80 and 90 in the Midwest and Interstate 5 in California .

3107
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
The boards read : " Air Bag Safety : Everyone Buckled , Kids in Back . "

3108
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Janet Dewey , executive director of the industry-funded National Automobile Occupant Protection Campaign , said most of the injuries to children occurred because they were not wearing seatbelts .

3109
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
A child 's chances of being killed in a car accident , whether the vehicle was equipped with an air bag or not , is reduced by 29 percent when they are in the rear seat , she said .

3110
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
The auto industry was about three to six years away from introducing " smart " air bags with the ability to detect the size and position of an occupant and adjust inflation pressures accordingly .

3111
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Current air bags were designed to halt the forward momentum of an average-sized , unbelted adult male , not a small child .

3112
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Automakers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to allow them to introduce air bags that inflate less aggressively to help reduce unwanted injuries .

3113
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
" Even if changes are made to airbags today , we 'd still have 20 million vehicles on the road with current technology , " Dewey said . "

3140
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
" These developments ... cause me grave concern , " Clinton said at a campaign stop in Troy , Tennessee .

3141
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
But he added , " It is premature at this time , and I want to emphasize that , highly premature to speculate on any response we might have . "

Clinton said Iraqi military forces overran the city of Arbil , which has been held since 1994 by Kurdish rebels who Baghdad says are backed by Iran .

3144
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000

Algerian security forces said in a statement that two people were killed and six were wounded when a home-made bomb ripped through a restaurant in the coastal town of Staoueli .

Newspapers said it killed two women and five children .

3167
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Algerian newspapers quoted the Human Rights National Observatory ( ONDH ) , a government-appointed watchdog , as saying earlier in August that about 1,400 civilians had been killed in bomb attacks blamed on Moslem guerrillas in the past two years .

3168
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
An estimated 50,000 people have died in Algeria 's violence pitting Moslem rebels against government forces since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead .

00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Iranian security forces burst into the home of a German cultural attache in Tehran a month ago and seized his guests for questioning , Bonn 's foreign ministry said on Saturday .

3172
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
A spokesman said he could substantially confirm a report in the news weekly Der Spiegel , which said Iranian secret police burst in while attache Jens Gust was entertaining six Iranian writers and their wives .

3173
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Gust was threatened with violence , then locked into a room to be interrogated on suspicion of " promoting activities hostile to the state " while his guests were taken away , the magazine said .

3174
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
The ministry spokesman said the German embassy immediately made a sharp protest to the Tehran government .

3175
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
The Iranian ambassador was also summoned to the ministry in Bonn to hear a sharp protest and " disapproval of this glaring breach of the principles of international law " , he added .

3176
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Iran subsequently said it regretted the incident , which it said had been the result of a misunderstanding .

3177
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
All those detained appeared to have been freed , the spokesman said .

3178
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Relations between the two countries are currently under strain because of the testimony in a Berlin court of former Iranian president Abolhassan Banisadr .

3179
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Banisadr , an avowed opponent of the Tehran government who now lives in exile , accused top Iranian leaders of personally ordering the assassination of three exiled Kurdish leaders in a Berlin restaurant in 1992 .

3180
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Iran has asked Germany to extradite Banisadr , who is due is due back in Berlin next Thursday to continue his testimony .

3181
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Banisadr , who received political asylum in France after fleeing there in 1981 , told Der Spiegel he did not plan to ask for a guarantee of safe conduct .

3182
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
If Germany were to extradite him , he said , it would " lose face before the whole world " .

3183
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
German prosecutors have already accused Iran 's intelligence minister Ali Fallahiyan of ordering the killing of the Kurdish leaders .

3184
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Iran , which denies the allegations , urged German authorities to disregard Banisadr 's testimony and said it could hurt relations .

VENICE , Italy 1996-08-31

3218
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Dublin-born director Neil Jordan says he never lost more sleep over a film than over " Michael Collins " , his controversial epic about the IRA which has its premiere on Saturday at the Venice Film Festival .

3219
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
The film , starring Liam Neeson and Julia Roberts , recounts the life of Michael Collins , the Irish Republican Army 's Director of Intelligence who fought for Irish independence from 1919 to 1921 .

3220
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Although not due for release in Britain until early next year , some politicians have already said they feared it would fan sectarian tensions in British-ruled Northern Ireland .

3221
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Jordan defends his decision to make the film , whose screenplay he wrote himself after years of research , saying it was " more about history than any political statement " .

3222
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
" The film spares neither the Irish nor the British in its depiction of the savagery of the time , " Jordan said in a statement released by Warner Bros . "

3223
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
How often has independence been achieved without bloodshed ?

3224
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Very rarely . "

3225
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Jordan , whose 1992 film " The Crying Game " also came under fire for what was perceived as a sympathetic portrayal of the IRA , said Collins was more than just a revolutionary .

3226
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
" He developed techniques of guerilla warfare later copied by independence movements around the world , from Mao Tse-Tung in China to Yitzak Shamir in Israel , " Jordan said .

3227
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
" Collins would never be a proponent of contemporary terrorism as practised today .

3228
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
He was a soldier and a statesman and , over time , a man of peace . "

3229
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Leeson , the Northern Ireland-born actor who was nominated for an Oscar for best actor for his performance in " Schindler 's List " , plays the lead role in Jordan 's film .

3230
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Aidan Quinn portrays Harry Boland , Collins ' best friend , and rival for the love of Kitty Kiernan , played by Roberts .

3231
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Much of the film was shot on location in Dublin with Jordan using thousands of its citizens as unpaid extras .

3232
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
A set , however , was used for the fighting scenes .

3233
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Noting that information about Collins was " as mysterious as the existence he maintained " , Jordan said he made some historical assumptions in the film .

3234
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
" I have made choices about certain events based on my own extensive research into his letters and reported speeches , " he said . "

3235
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I wanted to make this a story as accurate as possible without killing it dramatically and I think I have .

3236
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
It is a very true film . "

3237
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
One of the assumptions is his interpretation of the murky circumstances surrounding the shooting death of Collins , who had broken with his comrades when he sought a negotiated settlement with Britain , in an ambush in 1922 .

3238
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
" I have never lost more sleep over the making of a film than I have over ' Michael Collins ' , but I 'll never make a more important one , " Jordan said .

3239
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
" In the life of one person you can tell the events that formed the north and south of Ireland as they are today . "

3240
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
