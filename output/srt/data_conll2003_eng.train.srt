4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The European Commission said on Thursday it disagreed with German advice to consumers to shun British lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep .

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Germany 's representative to the European Union 's veterinary committee Werner Zwingmann said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than Britain until the scientific advice was clearer .

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
" We do n't support any such recommendation because we do n't see any grounds for it , " the Commission 's chief spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas told a news briefing .

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
He said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the European Union .

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
He said a proposal last month by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler to ban sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health .

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Fischler proposed EU-wide measures after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease .

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But Fischler agreed to review his proposal after the EU 's standing veterinary committee , mational animal health officials , questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health .

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Spanish Farm Minister Loyola de Palacio had earlier accused Fischler at an EU farm ministers ' meeting of causing unjustified alarm through " dangerous generalisation . "

12
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
.

13
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Only France and Britain backed Fischler 's proposal .

14
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The EU 's scientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to re-examine the issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials .

15
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a brain-wasting disease similar to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste .

16
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
British farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep , but expressed concern that German government advice to consumers to avoid British lamb might influence consumers across Europe .

17
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
" What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take Germany 's lead , " Welsh National Farmers ' Union ( NFU ) chairman John Lloyd Jones said on BBC radio .

18
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Bonn has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in March after a British report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef .

19
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total imports .

20
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports .

LONDON 1996-08-22

23
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A rare early handwritten draft of a song by U.S. guitar legend Jimi Hendrix was sold for almost $ 17,000 on Thursday at an auction of some of the late musician 's favourite possessions .

24
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A Florida restaurant paid 10,925 pounds ( $ 16,935 ) for the draft of " Ai n't no telling " , which Hendrix penned on a piece of London hotel stationery in late 1966 .

25
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
At the end of a January 1967 concert in the English city of Nottingham he threw the sheet of paper into the audience , where it was retrieved by a fan .

26
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Buyers also snapped up 16 other items that were put up for auction by Hendrix 's former girlfriend Kathy Etchingham , who lived with him from 1966 to 1969 .

27
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
They included a black lacquer and mother of pearl inlaid box used by Hendrix to store his drugs , which an anonymous Australian purchaser bought for 5,060 pounds ( $ 7,845 ) .

28
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The guitarist died of a drugs overdose in 1970 aged 27 .

31
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
China on Thursday accused Taipei of spoiling the atmosphere for a resumption of talks across the Taiwan Strait with a visit to Ukraine by Taiwanese Vice President Lien Chan this week that infuriated Beijing .

32
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Speaking only hours after Chinese state media said the time was right to engage in political talks with Taiwan , Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told Reuters : " The necessary atmosphere for the opening of the talks has been disrupted by the Taiwan authorities . "

33
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
State media quoted China 's top negotiator with Taipei , Tang Shubei , as telling a visiting group from Taiwan on Wednesday that it was time for the rivals to hold political talks .

34
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
" Now is the time for the two sides to engage in political talks ...

35
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that is to end the state of hostility , " Thursday 's overseas edition of the People 's Daily quoted Tang as saying .

36
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The foreign ministry 's Shen told Reuters Television in an interview he had read reports of Tang 's comments but gave no details of why the negotiator had considered the time right for talks with Taiwan , which Beijing considers a renegade province .

37
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
China , which has long opposed all Taipei efforts to gain greater international recognition , was infuriated by a visit to Ukraine this week by Taiwanese Vice President Lien .

41
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Consultations should be held to set the time and format of the talks , the official Xinhua news agency quoted Tang Shubei , executive vice chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits , as saying late on Wednesday .

FRANKFURT 1996-08-22

44
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
German first-time registrations of motor vehicles jumped 14.2 percent in July this year from the year-earlier period , the Federal office for motor vehicles said on Thursday .

45
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The office said 356,725 new cars were registered in July 1996 -- 304,850 passenger cars and 15,613 trucks .

46
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The figures represent a 13.6 percent increase for passenger cars and a 2.2 percent decline for trucks from July 1995 .

47
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Motor-bike registration rose 32.7 percent in the period .

48
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The growth was partly due to an increased number of Germans buying German cars abroad , while manufacturers said that domestic demand was weak , the federal office said .

49
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Almost all German car manufacturers posted gains in registration numbers in the period .

50
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Volkswagen AG won 77,719 registrations , slightly more than a quarter of the total .

51
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Opel AG together with General Motors came in second place with 49,269 registrations , 16.4 percent of the overall figure .

52
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Third was Ford with 35,563 registrations , or 11.7 percent .

53
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Only Seat and Porsche had fewer registrations in July 1996 compared to last year 's July .

54
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Seat posted 3,420 registrations compared with 5522 registrations in July a year earlier .

55
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Porsche 's registrations fell to 554 from 643 .

Israel 's outgoing peace negotiator with Syria said on Thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup .

98
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Itamar Rabinovich , who as Israel 's ambassador to Washington conducted unfruitful negotiations with Syria , told Israel Radio it looked like Damascus wanted to talk rather than fight .

99
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
" It appears to me the Syrian priority is still to negotiate .

100
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The Syrians are confused , they are definitely tense , but the general assessment here in Washington is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup , " he said .

101
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Rabinovich is winding up his term as ambassador .

102
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He will be replaced by Eliahu Ben-Elissar , a former Israeli envoy to Egypt and right-wing Likud party politician .

103
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Israel on Wednesday sent Syria a message , via Washington , saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions .

104
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But it slammed Damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere .

105
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported that Damascus had recently test fired a missile .

106
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes .

107
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
" The message that we sent to ( Syrian President Hafez al- ) Assad is that Israel is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations , " Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio in an interview .

108
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Tension has mounted since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June vowing to retain the Golan Heights Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war .

109
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan since 1991 despite the previous government 's willingness to make Golan concessions .

110
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Peace talks between the two sides were last held in February .

111
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
" The voices coming out of Damascus are bad , not good .

112
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The media ...

113
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
are full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying ...

114
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
this artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners , " Levy said .

115
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
" We expect from Syria , if its face is to peace , that it will answer Israel 's message to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal , " he said . "

116
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We do not want a war , God forbid .

117
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No one benefits from wars . "

118
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Israel 's Channel Two television said Damascus had sent a " calming signal " to Israel .

119
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It gave no source for the report .

120
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Netanyahu and Levy 's spokesmen said they could not confirm it .

121
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000

125
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
" This is not true .

126
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Up to today , we have no knowledge of any nurse stranded or kept in Libya without her will , and we have not received any complaint , " the Polish embassy 's charge d'affaires in Tripoli , Tadeusz Awdankiewicz , told Reuters by telephone .

127
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Poland 's labour ministry said this week it would send a team to Libya to investigate , but Awdankiewicz said the probe was prompted by some nurses complaining about their work conditions such as non-payment of their salaries .

128
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He said that there are an estimated 800 Polish nurses working in Libya .

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
An Iranian exile group based in Iraq vowed on Thursday to extend support to Iran 's Kurdish rebels after they were attacked by Iranian troops deep inside Iraq last month .

133
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
A Mujahideen Khalq statement said its leader Massoud Rajavi met in Baghdad the Secretary-General of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran ( KDPI ) Hassan Rastegar on Wednesday and voiced his support to Iran 's rebel Kurds .

134
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
" Rajavi emphasised that the Iranian Resistance would continue to stand side by side with their Kurdish compatriots and the resistance movement in Iranian Kurdistan , " it said .

135
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
A spokesman for the group said the meeting " signals a new level of cooperation between Mujahideen Khalq and the Iranian Kurdish oppositions " .

136
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Iran heavily bombarded targets in northern Iraq in July in pursuit of KDPI guerrillas based in Iraqi Kurdish areas outside the control of the government in Baghdad .

137
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Iraqi Kurdish areas bordering Iran are under the control of guerrillas of the Iraqi Kurdish Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) group .

138
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
PUK and Iraq 's Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) the two main Iraqi Kurdish factions , have had northern Iraq under their control since Iraqi forces were ousted from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War .

139
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Clashes between the two parties broke out at the weekend in the most serious fighting since a U.S.-sponsored ceasefire last year .

Kandahar is the headquarters of the opposition Taleban militia .

180

287
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Finland 's trade surplus rose to 3.83 billion markka in April from 3.43 billion in March , the National Customs Board ( NCB ) said in a statement on Thursday .

288
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The value of exports fell one percent year-on-year in April and the value of imports fell two percent , NCB said .

295
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The Bank of Finland earlier estimated the April trade surplus at 3.2 billion markka with exports projected at 14.5 billion and imports at 11.3 billion .

296
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The NCB 's official monthly trade statistics are lagging behind due to changes in customs procedures when Finland joined the European Union at the start of 1995 .

The Finance Ministry raised the price for tap sales of the Dutch government 's new 5.75 percent bond due September 2002 to 99.95 from 99.90 .

301
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000

BONN 1996-08-22

306
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Germany 's Agriculture Ministry suggested on Wednesday that consumers avoid eating meat from British sheep until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to the animals .

307
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
" Until this is cleared up by the European Union 's scientific panels -- and we have asked this to be done as quickly as possible -- ( consumers ) should if at all possible give preference to sheepmeat from other countries , " ministry official Werner Zwingmann told ZDF television .

308
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
" I do not want to say that there is a concrete danger for consumers , " he added . "

309
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
There are too many holes in what we know , and these must be filled very quickly . "

310
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Bonn has led efforts to ensure consumer protection tops the list of priorities in dealing with the mad cow crisis , which erupted in March when Britain acknowledged humans could contract a similar illness by eating contaminated beef .

311
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The European Commission agreed this month to rethink a proposal to ban the use of suspect sheep tissue after some EU veterinary experts questioned whether it was justified .

312
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler had proposed banning sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease .

313
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But some members of the EU 's standing veterinary committee questioned whether the action was necessary given the slight risk to human health .

314
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The question is being studied separately by two EU scientific committees .

315
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a similar brain-wasting disease to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste .

316
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
British officials say sheep meat is perfectly safe to eat .

317
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
ZDF said Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total imports .

318
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports .

319
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
After the British government admitted a possible link between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent , the EU imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports .

320
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
EU leaders agreed at a summit in June to a progressive lifting of the ban as Britain takes parallel measures to eradicate the disease .

Sir Mark Prescott landed his first group one victory in 25 years as a trainer when his top sprinter Pivotal , a 100-30 chance , won the Nunthorpe Stakes on Thursday .

358
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The three-year-old , partnered by veteran George Duffield , snatched a short head verdict in the last stride to deny Eveningperformance ( 16-1 ) , trained by Henry Candy and ridden by Chris Rutter .

359
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Hever Golf Rose ( 11-4 ) , last year 's Prix de l ' Abbaye winner at Longchamp , finished third , a further one and a quarter lengths away with the 7-4 favourite Mind Games in fourth .

361
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Prescott , reluctant to go into the winner 's enclosure until the result of the photo-finish was announced , said : " Twenty-five years and I have never been there so I thought I had better wait a bit longer . "

362
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He added : " It 's very sad to beat Henry Candy because I am godfather to his daughter . "

363
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Like Prescott , Jack Berry , trainer of Mind Games , had gone into Thursday 's race in search of a first group one success after many years around the top of his profession .

Berry said : " I`m disappointed but I do n't feel suicidal .

In a telephone call to a local newspaper from his holiday home in Spain , Dalglish said : " We came to the same opinion , albeit the club came to it a little bit earlier than me . "

410
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He added : " If no one asked , I never opened my mouth .

411
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I have stayed out of the way and let them get on with the job .

SYDNEY 1996-08-22

633
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Australian Davis Cup captain John Newcombe on Thursday signalled his possible resignation if his team loses an away tie against Croatia next month .

634
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The former Wimbledon champion said the immediate future of Australia 's Davis Cup coach Tony Roche could also be determined by events in Split .

635
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
" If we lose this one , Tony and I will have to have a good look at giving someone else a go , " Newcombe was quoted as saying in Sydney 's Daily Telegraph newspaper .

636
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Australia face Croatia in the world group qualifying tie on clay from September 20-22 .

637
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Under Newcombe 's leadership , Australia were relegated from the elite world group last year , the first time the 26-time Davis Cup winners had slipped from the top rank .

638
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Since taking over as captain from Neale Fraser in 1994 , Newcombe 's record in tandem with Roche , his former doubles partner , has been three wins and three losses .

639
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Newcombe has selected Wimbledon semifinalist Jason Stoltenberg , Patrick Rafter , Mark Philippoussis , and Olympic doubles champions Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde to face the Croatians .

640
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The home side boasts world number six Goran Ivanisevic , and Newcombe conceded his players would be hard-pressed to beat the Croatian number one .

641
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
" We are ready to fight to our last breath -- Australia must play at its absolute best to win , " said Newcombe , who described the tie as the toughest he has faced as captain .

642
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Australia last won the Davis Cup in 1986 , but they were beaten finalists against Germany three years ago under Fraser 's guidance .

1054
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Women who get measles while pregnant may have babies at higher risk of Crohn 's disease , a debilitating bowel disorder , researchers said on Friday .

1055
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Three out of four Swedish babies born to mothers who caught measles developed serious cases of Crohn 's disease , the researchers said .

1056
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Dr Andrew Wakefield of the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine and colleagues screened 25,000 babies delivered at University Hospital , Uppsala , between 1940 and 1949 .

1057
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Four of the mothers had measles while pregnant .

1058
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
" Three of the four children had Crohn 's disease , " Wakefield 's group wrote in the Lancet medical journal .

1059
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Crohn 's is an inflammation of the bowel that can sometimes require surgery .

1060
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It causes diarrhoea , abdominal pain and weight loss .

1061
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The researchers said the three children involved had especially severe cases .

1062

Exposure to viruses can often cause birth defects .

1063

Garlic pills do n't lower cholesterol , study finds .

LONDON 1996-08-22

1087
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Garlic pills may not lower blood cholesterol and studies that show they do may be flawed , British researchers have reported .

1088
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
A study by a team of doctors at Oxford University has found people with high blood cholesterol do not benefit significantly from taking garlic tablets .

1089
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The study involved 115 people with high blood cholesterol levels .

1090
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
They were given 900 milligrams a day of dried garlic powder or placebo tablets . "

1091
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
There were no significant differences between the groups receiving garlic and placebo , " they wrote in the Journal of the Royal College of Physicians .

1092
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Those taking part were told to eat a low-fat diet for six weeks before they started taking the pills , and their blood cholesterol measured before and after the six-week period .

1093
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
The researchers said this would make their findings more accurate .

1094
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Several studies have found garlic pills can lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol .

1095
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But the Oxford team disputed these findings and said either previous trials may have been interpreted incorrectly , those taking part were not given special diets beforehand or the duration of the studies may have been too short .

1096
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The six-month trial was funded by the British Heart Foundation and Lichtwer Pharma GmbH , which makes Kwai brand garlic tablets .

1097
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
The study did not address whether whole garlic could affect cholesterol .

LONDON 1996-08-22

1101
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Britain said on Thursday it would give 25 million pounds ( $ 39 million ) of development aid to the Caribbean island of Montserrat , where much of the population living in the south has fled to avoid a volcano .

1102
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The volcano in the Soufriere hills has erupted three times in the past 13 months and last April some 4,500 people living in the capital , Plymouth , and southern areas were evacuated to the north , where many are living in public shelters and schools .

1103
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
" This assistance will provide a fast track development programme for the designated ( northern ) safe area , " Britain 's Overseas Development Administration said in a statement .

1104
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Britain gave 8.5 million pounds ( $ 13 million ) to Montserrat , which is one of its dependent territories , when the volcano first became active .

1105
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Overseas Development Minister Lynda Chalker said a recent census had shown most Montserratians wanted to remain on the island . "

1106
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The development of the north will help them to do just that , " she said .

NEW YORK 1996-08-22

1110
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
World number one Pete Sampras , seeking his first Grand Slam title of the year , and women 's top seed Steffi Graf , aiming for her third , should be able to ease into the year 's final major , which begins on Monday .

1111
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Sampras opens the defence of his U.S. Open crown against David Rikl of the Czech Republic , while top-ranked Graf begins her title defence against Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia .

1112
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Wednesday 's U.S. Open draw ceremony revealed that both title holders should run into their first serious opposition in the third round .

1113
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Looming in Sampras 's future is a likely third-round date with recent nemesis Mark Philippoussis , the rising Australian who took out Sampras in the third round of the Australian Open in January .

1114
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Sampras avenged that defeat with a straight sets win over the 19-year-old power hitter in the second round at Wimbledon and their rubber match in New York could provide some first-week fireworks .

1115
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
While only a stunning upset will keep Graf from sailing through to a predictable semifinal showdown with third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario , the German star could also be tested in the third round where she will probably face 28th-ranked veteran Natasha Zvereva of Belarus .

1116
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
There will be no repeat of last year 's men 's final with eighth-ranked Andre Agassi landing in Sampras 's half of the draw .

1117
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Bumping Agassi up to the sixth seeding avoided the possibility that he would run into Sampras as early as the quarter-finals , but they could lock horns in the semis .

1118
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Olympic champion Agassi meets Karim Alami of Morocco in the first round .

1119
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Surprise second seed Michael Chang , ranked third in the world , opens against Czech Daniel Vacek , while women 's second seed Monica Seles drew American Anne Miller as her first victim .

1120
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Second-ranked Austrian Thomas Muster , who was seeded third , did not have the luck of the draw with him .

1121
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
In the first round Muster faces American Richey Reneberg , who has been playing some of the best tennis of his career of late .

1122
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
If he survives , Muster is seeded to run into either fifth-seeded Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands or 12th-seeded American Todd Martin in the quarter-finals in Chang 's half of the draw .

1123
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Perhaps the best , yet most unfortunate , first-round matchup of the men 's competition pits eighth seed Jim Courier against retiring star Stefan Edberg .

1124
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The popular Swede is playing his final major tournament next week and the two-time champion 's Grand Slam farewell could well be a one-match affair .

1125
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
With the exception of a Philippoussis showdown , Sampras looks to have landed in a comfortable quarter of the draw with the likes of Frenchman Cedric Pioline and ailing French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov , who is nursing a rib injury , in his path .

1126
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Seles , runner-up to Graf last year , is seeded to run into fifth-ranked German Anke Huber in the quarter-finals with fourth seed Conchita Martinez or eighth-seeded Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport looking like her most likely semifinal opponents .

1127
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But Huber will be tested immediately with a first-round encounter against dangerous 18th-ranked South African Amanda Coetzer .

1128
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Sanchez Vicario , runner-up to Graf at the French Open and Wimbledon , begins play against a qualifier in a quarter of the draw that includes young talent Martina Hingis , the 16th seed , before a probable quarter-final clash with seventh-seeded veteran Jana Novotna .

Top-seeded Thomas Muster of Austria was beaten 6-3 7-5 by 123rd-ranked Daniel Nestor of Canada on Wednesday in his first match of the $ 2 million Canadian Open .

1134
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
A lefthander with a strong serve , Nestor kept the rallies short by constantly attacking the net and the tactic worked in the second-round match against Muster , playing his first match after receiving a first-round bye along with the other top eight seeds .

1135
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The tournament also lost its second seed on the third day of play when second-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia was beaten 6-7(3-7 ) 6-4 6-4 by unseeded Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden .

1137
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Eighth seed Marc Rosset of Switzerland was eliminated in a one hour , 55 minute battle by unseeded Mark Philippoussis of Australia .

1138
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Philippoussis saved a match point at 5-6 in the third-set tie break before winning 6-3 3-6 7-6 ( 8-6 ) .

1139

Philippoussis 's compatriot , 13th seed Jason Stoltenberg , was not as fortunate .

1140
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
He held one match point at 9-8 in a marathon third-set tie break but was beaten 5-7 7-6 ( 7-1 ) 7-6 ( 13-11 ) by unseeded Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic .

1141
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
" I knew I had to serve well and keep the points short and that 's what I was able to do , " said Nestor , who ranks 10th in doubles .

1142
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
There were only two service breaks in the match .

1143
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The lanky Canadian broke Muster at 4-3 in the first set and 5-5 in the second before ending the match on his third match point when the Austrian hit a service return long .

1144
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
" I probably did n't hit five ground strokes in the whole match , " said Muster , only partly joking . "

1145
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
The way he was chipping and charging and serving and volleying I did n't really get my timing playing from the baseline . "

1146
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
" He played a good match , took a few chances , and every time he was down he was able to come up with a big first serve . "

1147
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Playing at night was not Muster 's preference . "

1148
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I asked for a day match and they gave me a night match , " he said . "

1149
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I do n't like playing under the lights but maybe it would not have made any difference . "

1150
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Ivanisevic rallied from a 2-5 deficit in the first set but then played erratically against the 44th-ranked Tillstrom , who was a surprise winner over his famous compatriot Stefan Edberg in the second round at Wimbledon .

1151
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Ivanisevic hit 32 aces but was outplayed from the back court by the 24-year-old Tillstrom .

1152
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The sixth-ranked Ivanisevic , who lost in the final at Indianapolis to world number one Pete Sampras of the U.S. last Sunday , made a quick getaway after his loss but did say : " Something was not there when I arrived ( in Toronto ) .

1153
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I did n't feel good .

1154
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And I did n't have a good feeling as soon as I lost in my doubles ( on Tuesday ) . "

1155
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
" I thought he looked a little unfocused at certain times on his ground strokes , " said Tillstrom .

1156
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The 19-year-old Philippoussis , who beat Sampras in the third round of this year 's Australian Open , stayed calm in a nervy third-set tie break against Rosset .

1157
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
" I 'm pleased because I did n't play that great today , but I fought really well , " he said . "

1158
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
When I was down 2-5 in the tiebreak ( in the third set ) , I just thought about winning my two serves and hoped that he might get tight .

1159
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Then he shanked a forehand at to make it 5-all and that helped me back . "

For three hours on Tuesday , around 100 members of the Maoist rebel group Shining Path took control of Alomella Robles , a small village about 345 miles ( 550 km ) northeast of Lima , the sources said .

1307
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Some guerrillas made villagers listen to propaganda speeches in the village centre , others forced passing motorists out of their cars and daubed their vehicles with slogans .

1308
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
By Wednesday , the whereabouts of the eight hostages was still not known , the sources said .

1309
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
In recent months the Shining Path , severely weakened since the 1992 capture of its leader Abimael Guzman , has been stepping up both its military and propaganda activities .

1310
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Peru 's guerrilla conflicts have cost at least 30,000 lives and $ 25 billion in damage to infrastructure since 1980 .

PARAMARIBO , Surinam 1996-08-21

1313
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Flamboyant former Surinamese rebel leader Ronny Brunswijk was in custody on Wednesday charged with attempted murder , police said .

1314
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Brunswijk turned himself into police after Freddy Pinas , a Surinamese-born visitor from the Netherlands , accused Brunswijk of trying to kill him on Sunday after a bar-room brawl in the small mining town of Moengo , about 56 miles ( 90 km ) east of Paramaribo , said police spokesman Ro Gajadhar .

1315
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Pinas , showing cuts and bruises on his face , told reporters the former head of the feared Jungle Command had tried and failed to shoot him after Pinas objected to Brunswijk 's advances toward his wife .

1316
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Pinas said Brunswijk then ordered his bodyguards to beat him up .

1317
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Brunswijk , 35 , denied the charges and said he had merely defended himself when Pinas attacked him with a bottle .

1318
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It was the second time Brunswijk had been charged with attempted murder in less than two years .

1319
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
In 1994 he served two months in prison for shooting a thief in the buttocks .

1320
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Brunswijk led a rebel group of about 1,000 in a 1986 uprising against the regime of military strongman Desi Bouterse .

1321
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The conflict , which killed more than 500 and caused thousands to flee to neighbouring French Guiana in the late 1980s , eventually paved the way to democratic elections in 1991 .

1322
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Despite numerous problems with authorities , Brunswijk went on to become a successful businessman with mining and logging interests .

1323
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
He also manages and occasionally plays for one of the leading local soccer teams .

A Hong Kong carpenter was arrested in the Thai seaside town of Pattaya after police seized 18 kg ( 39.7 pounds ) of heroin following complaints by residents of a noisy saw , police said on Thursday .

1327
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Cheung Siu Man , 40 , was arrested late on Wednesday after police searched a house and found heroin in bags and hidden in hollow spaces in wooden planks , police said .

1328
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The suspect said he was hired to make a wooden box from the planks in order to hide the heroin .

1329
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Police went to the house after receiving complaints of sawing during the night over the course of several days .

1330
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
When they arrived to investigate , police saw people escaping from the back door so they decided to search the house .

1331
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
The seized heroin has an estimated street value of about 300 million baht ( $ 12 million ) , police said .

1332
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Officials are now hunting for the suspect 's collaborators , police said .

1333
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Cheung was being detained pending formal charges , police said .

Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a four-day visit that follows rising friction between the two nations in recent weeks .

1337
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Downer was to meet Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and sign an agreement on an Australian consulate in Hong Kong , an official of the Australian embassy in Beijing said .

1338
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
China will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong , a British colony , in mid-1997 .

1339
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Relations between China and Australia have been strained in recent weeks because of Australia 's plan to sell uranium to China 's rival Taiwan .

1340
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Other issues affecting ties include plans by an Australian cabinet minister to visit Taiwan , a security pact between Canberra and Washington and a possible visit to Australia next month by Tibet 's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama .

1341
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Downer is the first Australian minister to visit China since the new conservative government took office in Canberra in March .

NABLUS , West Bank 1996-08-22

1344
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
A West Bank bookseller charged on Thursday that the Palestinian Information Ministry has forced him to sign an undertaking not to distribute books written by critics of Israeli-PLO self-rule deals .

1345
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
" They made me sign an undertaking not to sell the books to anyone at the risk of legal action .

1346
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
One official told me ' you have to either destroy the books or return them to Amman ' , " Daoud Makkawi , owner of the Nablus-based al-Risala bookshop , told Reuters .

1347
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
He said ministry officials made him sign this a few weeks ago after he brought about a dozen copies from Jordan of a book by Edward Said , a prominent scholar at New York City 's Columbia University .

1348
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Said , a U.S. citizen of Palestinian origin , has been an outspoken critic of the 1993 Israeli-PLO self-rule deal and has written at least two books on the accord .

1349
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
On Wednesday a bookseller in the West Bank town of Ramallah said police about a month ago confiscated several copies of two of Said 's books on the Israel-PLO self-rule deals .

1350
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Palestinian Information Ministry Director-General Mutawakel Taha denied that ministry officials forced anyone to sign any undertaking and insisted that the Palestinian Authority has no plans to censor books .

1351
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
" There is no strategy to ban books or to suppress freedom of expression in any form whatsoever , " Taha told Reuters .

1352
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But Taha said that the absence of relevent legislations may have resulted in some mistakes by some security officials .

1353
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
" This may explain some mistakes against some journalists and writers , " he said .

1354
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Daoud said books by other authors , including British Journalist Patrick Seale , were also banned .

1355
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
He said that security officials often visit his shop to make sure he was not selling the books .

1356
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
" I think this is a bad beginning .

1357
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
If we have confidence , why should we be afraid of the other opinion ? "

1358
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Daoud said .

1359
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Thousands of books were banned from sale in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by the Israeli military authorities before the Jewish state handed over parts of the two areas to the PLO under a self-rule deal in 1994 .

Egypt blames Istanbul control tower for accident .

1361
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
CAIRO 1996-08-22

1362
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The chairman of national carrier EgyptAir on Thursday blamed the control tower at Istanbul airport for the EgyptAir plane accident .

1363
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Twenty people were injured on Wednesday when the EgyptAir Boeing 707 overshot the runway , caught fire , hit a taxi and skipped across a road onto a railway line .

1364
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Chairman Mohamed Fahim Rayyan told a news conference at Cairo airport : " The control tower should have allocated the plane another runway , instead of the one the plane landed on . "

1365
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
" The one it landed on is 2,250 metres ( 2,460 yards ) long while the other one if more than 3,000 metres ( 3,300 yards ) long and is less steep , " he added .

1366
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
He said a Turkish civil aviation authority official had made the same point and he noted that a Turkish plane had a similar accident there in 1994 .

1367
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The EgyptAir pilot blamed Turkish airport staff for misleading him .

1368
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The landing took place after a rainstorm .

1369
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
" Its not an accident .

1370
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It 's very wet .

1371
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
The brake action is very poor and the tower said it 's medium .

1372
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That 's wrong , " the pilot told private Ihlas news agency in English .

1373

1375
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The Egyptian government will have nothing more to do with the Sudanese government because it continues to shelter and support Egyptian militants , President Hosni Mubarak said in a speech on Thursday .

1376
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Egypt says the Sudanese government helped the Moslem militants who tried to kill Mubarak in Addis Ababa last year .

1377
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It sponsored last week 's U.N. Security Council resolution threatening a ban on Sudanese flights abroad if Khartoum does not hand over three men accused in the Addis Ababa incident .

1378
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The sanctions will come into effect in November if Sudan fails to extradite the men , but Sudan says it cannot hand them over to Ethiopia for trial because they are not in Sudan .

1379
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
" We are still eager that nothing should affect the Sudanese people but we will not deal with the current regime or the Turabi front or whatever , " Mubarak told a group of academics .

1380
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Hassan al-Turabi is the leader of the National Islamic Front , the political force behind the Sudanese government .

1381
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
" I do n't want to go into more details than that but there are more details and they are bitter .

1382
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
There are terrorists they are sheltering and they make Sudanese passorts for them and they get paid by them , " Mubarak said .

1383
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
He did not say if Egypt would go so far as to break relations , a step it has been reluctant to take , ostensibly because it would affect ordinary Sudanese .

1390
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
" Profit-taking sales in the afternoon showed the latest gains of the index were actually a reaction rise .

1391
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I expect the market to go as far down as 63,000 tomorrow if sales continue , " said Burcin Mavituna from Interbank .

1392
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Brokers said profit taking sales had come especially as the index approached the 65,000 resistance level .

1393
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
They said the index could also rise towards 65,000 if the cheap share prices attracted buyers .

1394
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The market had its first resistance at 67,000 if it pierced 65,000 , they added .

1403
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Miss Universe , Venezuela 's Alicia Machado , left New Mexico on Thursday , refusing to answer questions about her weight or claims she was told to either go on a crash diet or give up her title .

1404
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Machado , 19 , flew to Los Angeles after slipping away from the New Mexico desert town of Las Cruces , where she attended the 1996 Miss Teen USA pageant on Wednesday .

1405
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
While Machado was not a contestant here , she came under intense scrutiny following reports she was given an ultimatum by Los Angeles-based Miss Universe Inc. to drop 27 pounds ( 12 kg ) in two weeks or risk losing her crown .

1406
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
In Venezuela , her mother told Reuters that Machado had a swollen face when she left home two weeks ago because she had her wisdom teeth extracted .

1407
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Marta Fajardo insisted her daughter , who weighed 112 pounds ( 51 kg ) when she won the Miss Universe title in Las Vegas in May , had perfectly normal eating habits .

1408
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
" Everybody has their own addiction to something or other but it 's not as if she eats cakes like crazy , " she said .

1409
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Organisers flatly denied ever threatening Machado but immediately put her under wraps and blocked access to her .

1410
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Dressed in a black strapless evening gown at Wednesday 's pageant , Machado was clearly heavier than the contestants but still won rave reviews after her brief appearance on stage .

1411
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
" Are you kidding ?

1412
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
She 's fantastic , " said Nikki Campbell , 28 , who went to the pageant . "

1413
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
She looked great .

1414
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Very sexy . "

1415
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Machado 's publicists said on Thursday she was scheduled to stay in Los Angeles for promotional work with sponsors before returning to Venezuela on Sept .

1417
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Beauty queens are high-profile personalities in Venezuela and Machado 's alleged weight problem made front page news this week .

1418
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It was an official of the Miss Venezuela Organisation who first said Machado had been told to lose weight fast .

1419
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
People close to her said she then eased up on her diet and indulged her passion for pasta and cake , but it was not clear how many pounds she gained and most people who saw her said she was still a long way from being fat .

1420
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Martin Brooks , president of Miss Universe Inc , said he spoke with Machado to assure her that organisers were not putting pressure on her .

1421
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
" She 's fine with it .

1422
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
She wished , as we all did , that it had n't happened but she 's spiritually and mentally terrific .

1423
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
There 's no problem whatsoever , " he told Reuters .

1424
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
He said the lifestyle associated with being Miss Universe could make routine exercise difficult .

1425
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
" The problem is they travel so much and are so busy that the ability to have any type of regimented routine workout does n't exist .

1426
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I dont know if Alicia is working out .

1427
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
We have n't talked about it because it has n't been an issue , " he said .

Dr. Jack Kevorkian attended his third suicide in less than a week on Thursday , bringing the body of a 40-year-old Missouri woman suffering from multiple sclerosis to a hospital emergency room , doctors said .

1432
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Dr Robert Aranosian , emergency room director at Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital , said Kevorkian brought in the body of Patricia Smith , of Lees Summit , Mo .

1433
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
, at midday and told doctors that she had been paralysed by the disease .

1434
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It was his second assisted-suicide in 36 hours and the 37th that he has acknowledged attending since starting his crusade for doctor assisted suicide in 1990 .

1435
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Kevorkian 's lawyer , Geoffrey Fieger , said those attending Smith 's death included her husband , David , a police officer , her father , James Poland , and Kevorkian .

1436
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000

1440

HAMBURG , Germany 1996-08-22

1454
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
A Hamburg court sentenced U.S. neo-Nazi leader Gary Lauck on Thursday to four years in prison for pumping banned extremist propaganda into Germany from his base in the United States .

1455
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Lauck , from Lincoln , Nebraska , yelled a tirade of abuse at the court after his conviction for inciting racial hatred .

1456
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
" The struggle will go on , " the 43-year-old shouted in German before being escorted out by security guards .

1457
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Lauck 's lawyer vowed he would appeal against the court 's decision , arguing that his client should have been set free because he had not committed any offence under German law .

1458
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
The German government hailed the conviction as a major victory in the fight against neo-Nazism .

1459
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Lauck 's worldwide network has been the main source of anti-Semitic propaganda material flowing into Germany since the 1970s .

1460
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
" Lauck possessed a well-oiled propaganda machine , honed during more than 20 years , " presiding judge Guenter Bertram told the court .

1461
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
" He set up a propaganda cannon and fired it at Germany . "

1462
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
said Bertram , who also read out extracts from Lauck 's material praising Hitler as " the greatest of all leaders " and describing the Nazi slaughter of millions of Jews as a myth .

1463
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Eager to put Lauck behind bars quickly and avoid a long and complex trial , prosecutor Bernd Mauruschat limited his charges to offences since 1994 .

1464
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
He had demanded a five-year jail term but said he was satisfied with the court 's sentence .

1465
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Publishing and distributing neo-Nazi material is illegal in Germany but Lauck 's defence team had argued that U.S freedom of speech laws meant he was free to produce his swastika-covered books , magazines , videos and flags in his homeland .

1466
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said in a statement he " welcomed the prosecution and conviction of one of the ringleaders of international neo-Nazism and biggest distributers of vicious racist publications " .

1467
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
" It is high time he was behind bars , " the opposition Social Democrats said in a statement .

1468
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Lauck , dressed in a sober blue suit and sporting his trademark Hitleresque black moustache , showed no sign of emotion as Bertram spent more than an hour reading out the verdict and explaining the court 's decision .

1469
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
But as Lauck was about to be led away , he turned to reporters and blurted out a virtually incomprehensible quick-fire diatribe against the court .

1470
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
" Neither the National Socialists ( Nazis ) nor the communists dared to kidnap an American citizen , " he shouted , in an oblique reference to his extradition to Germany from Denmark . "

1471
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
That 's the truth . "

1472
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
His attorney , Hans-Otto Sieg , told reporters outside the courtroom that the judges had not explained how a German court could judge someone for actions carried out in the United States .

1473
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Bertram said Lauck was obsessed by Nazism and devoted his life to leading his National Socialist German Workers ' Party Foreign Organisation ( NSDAP-AO ) , which derives its name from the full German title of Hitler 's Nazi party .

1474
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
During the three-month trial , the court dealt mainly with issues of the NSDAP-AO 's " NS Kampfruf " ( " National Socialist Battle Cry " ) magazine , filled with references to Aryan supremacy and defamatory statements about Jews .

1475
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
The court rejected Sieg 's argument that Lauck 's extradition from Denmark , where he was arrested in March last year at the request of German authorities , was illegal .

1476
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Lauck was also convicted of disseminating the symbols of anti-constitutional organisations .

1477
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
He will probably be free in around two and a half years .

1478
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The court ruled that the 15 months he has spent in custody since his arrest should be subtracted from his prison term .

1482
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
" I am reluctant to speculate but we are doing the preparations and the secretary-general is anxious to start the program , " said Undersecretary-General Yasushi Akashi .

1483
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
" It might be sooner than you think , " he told reporters after briefing the Security Council on arrangements for monitors needed to carry out the agreement .

PARIS 1996-08-22

1488
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Algerian security forces have shot dead three Moslem guerrillas suspected of killing a leading French bishop in western Algeria , the Algerian state-run television said on Thursday .

1489
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Security forces also arrested four other men sought for giving support to the slain Moslem rebels , the television said .

1490
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
The television , which did not say when the security forces killed the rebels , said the four arrested men confessed details of the assassination of the French Roman Catholic Bishop Pierre Claverie .

1491
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
The 58-year-old Claverie was killed in August 1 in a bomb blast at his residence in the western Algerian city of Oran , hours after he met visiting French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette in Algiers .

1492
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
An estimated 50,000 Algerians and more than 110 foreigners have been killed in Algeria 's violence pitting Moslem rebels against the Algerian government forces since early 1992 , when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists took a commanding lead .

U.S. President Bill Clinton had to drop the resort of Ballybunion from a whirlwind Irish tour last year .

1531

Two residents of the Atlantic resort , where Clinton was to have played golf with the Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring , have been invited to the Democratic party convention in Chicago on August 26-29 .

1532
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
They have been asked to bring with them the placards they waved when Clinton addressed Ireland at a packed ceremony in Dublin city centre on December 1 , last year .

1533
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
They read : " Ballybunion backs Clinton . "

1534
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
" The Democratic party have requested we bring our placards with us .

1535
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
We will be guests of the Kennedys , " said Frank Quilter , one of the two who have been invited to Chicago .

1536

Clinton made a triumphant Irish tour to back a Northern Ireland peace process but was forced to drop Ballybunion from a packed schedule at the last minute .

1539
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Germany said on Thursday it had received assurances from the Russian government that its forces would observe the latest ceasefire in Chechnya .

1540
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said top Bonn diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger had been assured by senior Russian officials that the ultimatum to storm and take the Chechen capital of Grozny was not valid .

1541
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
" The Russian side confirmed that the ceasefire is in place and they will keep to it , " Erdmann told Reuters after speaking by telephone to Ischinger , who had met the officials on a two-day visit to Moscow .

1542
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
He returned to Bonn on Thursday .

1543
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Ischinger is the political director of Bonn 's foreign ministry .

1544
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Ischinger said he met three Russian deputy foreign ministers and a vice defence minister , who confirmed Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov 's pledge that Moscow would seek a political solution under the aegis of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) .

1545
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
" The ultimatum ( to storm Grozny ) is no longer an issue , " he said quoting Ischinger , who had been sent to Moscow by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel as his personal envoy to urge an end to Moscow 's military campaign in the breakaway region .

1546
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Ischinger said the threat of a major assault to take Grozny had been the unauthorised initiative of the commanding general and not Moscow 's intention .

1547
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
The officials had been positive about Kinkel 's request on Wednesday that President Boris Yeltsin 's security chief Alexander Lebed should , on his return to Moscow , meet Tim Goldiman , the OSCE representative responsible for Chechnya , he said .

NEW DELHI 1996-08-22

1550
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
India said on Thursday that its opposition to a global nuclear test ban treaty did not mean New Delhi intended to enter into an arms race with neighbouring Pakistan and China .

1551
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Foreign Minister I.K. Gujral was asked at a news conference if India 's decision to block adoption of the accord in Geneva would lead to an arms race with Pakistan and China .

1552
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
" I do n't see that possibility because India is not entering into any arms race , " he said . "

1553
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Our not signing a new treaty does not mean we are going in for any new kind of weapons , particularly nuclear . "

1554
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
China , along with Britain , France , Russia and the United States , is a declared nuclear power .

1555
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
India carried out a nuclear test in 1974 but says it has not built the bomb .

1556
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Experts believe both India and Pakistan could quickly assemble nuclear weapons .

1557
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Gujral said he did not expect India 's veto of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) to damage bilateral ties with other nations .

1558
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
" I do not visualise its straining our bilateral relations with any country .

1559
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
The text has already been blocked , " he said .

1560
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Gujral said India would re-examine its position if the treaty , particularly a clause providing for its entry into force , was modified .

1561
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Asked what India would do if the pact were forwarded to the United Nations General Assembly , Gujral said : " That bridge I will cross when I come to it . "

1562
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
In a written statement released at the news conference , Gujral reiterated India 's objections to the treaty , under negotiation at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva .

1563
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
" It is a sad fact that the nuclear weapon states show no interest in giving up their nuclear hegemony , " the statement said .

1564
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Gujral said India had national security concerns that made it impossible for New Delhi to sign the CTBT .

1565
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
" Our security concerns oblige us to maintain our nuclear option , " he said , adding that India had exercised restraint in not carrying out any nuclear tests since the country 's lone test blast in 1974 .

1566
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
He said : " We cannot accept constraints on our option as long as nuclear weapon states continue to rely on their nuclear arsenals for their security " .

Siraj Mia died at Dhaka airport on May 9 during interogation by customs officials after arriving from London .

1572
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
His body bore multiple injuries , and his relatives complained that he was murdered .

1573
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
A post-mortem report suggested he might have been tortured .

1574
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
But customs authorities said the passenger was drunk and died of loss of blood from a deep cut in his wrist after he hit a glass sheet .

1575
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Fox , who arrived in Bangladesh on Tuesday on four-day visit , said Britain wanted Dhaka to act seriously on the case .

1576
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
" This is one of the reasons of my visit here ...

1577
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
this is an important issue in our relationship " , said Fox , who is due to leave for Nepal on Friday .

1578
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Fox said the incident had strained relations between the two governments .

1579
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
He said the Mia 's issue had been raised in the House of Commons .

1580
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Fox said he had brought up the issue at every meeting he had had with government leaders in Dhaka .

1581
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
He said the Bangladesh government had assured him it was taking the matter seriously .

1582
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
" The British government wants a thorough investigation and a just outcome , " he said .

1583
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Fox said the British government wanted an end to the alleged harassment of its nationals at Dhaka airport by customs officials .

" It seems that from across the border there is going to be a planned attempt to disrupt the elections , " Inderjit Gupta told reporters in the state capital Srinagar .

1590

The local polls next month will be the first since 1987 in the state , clamped under direct rule from New Delhi since 1990 .

1591
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
India has often accused Pakistan of abetting militancy in the valley , a charge Islamabad has always denied .

1592
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Gupta said there might be an increase in the number of people infiltrating the Kashmir valley to create disturbance in the region .

1593

" We noticed among the people who come from across the border , there is a growing number of foreign mercenaries , " Gupta said .

NEW DELHI 1996-08-22

1607
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
The Reserve bank of India governor C. Rangarajan said on Thursday that he expected the cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) maintained by banks to be reduced over the medium term .

1608
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
" Over the medium term , yes , " he told Reuters after addressing industrialists in the capital .

1609
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
He denied having said in a recent newspaper interview that the CRR could be raised if necessary .

1610
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
He said he was only trying ( in that newspaper report ) to explain the theoretical position on the use of the CRR by central banks to manage money supply .

1611
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Rangarajan explained that the cash reserve ratio was an instrument that central banks could use to regulate money supply by reducing or increasing the ratio .

1612
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
But in the current context , the government stood by an earlier commitment to reduce it over a period of time , he said in response to a question .

1616
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
The Reserve Bank of India Governor Chakravarty Rangarajan said on Thursday that a current account deficit of two percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) was sustainable given the currrent rate of growth .

1617
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
" The current account deficit of around two percent of GDP is a sustainable level of deficit given the expected real growth rate and the trends in imports and exports , " Rangarajan said in an address to business leaders in New Delhi .

1618
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Rangarajan said a current account deficit of two percent brought about by a 16-17 percent annual growth in exports and a 14-15 percent rise in imports along with an increase in non-debt flows could lead to a reduction in the debt-service ratio to below 20 percent over the next five years .

CALCUTTA 1996-08-22

1622
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Mother Teresa , known as the Saint of the Gutters , won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for bringing hope and dignity to millions of poor , unwanted people with her simple message : " The poor must know that we love them . "

1623
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
While the world heaps honours on her and even regards her as a living saint , the nun of Albanian descent maintains she is merely doing God 's work .

1624
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
" It gives me great joy and fulfilment to love and care for the poor and neglected , " she said . "

1625
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The poor do not need our sympathy and pity .

1626
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
They need our love and compassion . "

The diminutive Roman Catholic missionary was on respiratory support in intensive care in an Indian nursing home on Thursday after suffering heart failure .

1628
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
But an attending doctor said Mother Teresa , who turns 86 next Tuesday , was conscious and in stable condition .

1629
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
The task Mother Teresa began alone in 1949 in the slums of densely-populated Calcutta , and grew to touch the hearts of people around the world .

1630
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
When in 1979 she was told she had won the Nobel Peace Prize , she said characteristically : " I am unworthy . "

1631
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
The world disagreed , showering more than 80 national and international honours on her including the Bharat Ratna , or Jewel of India , the country 's highest civilian award .

1632
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Her health began to deteriorate in 1989 when she was fitted with a heart pacemaker .

1633
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
A year later , the Vatican announced she was stepping down as Superior of her Missionaries of Charity order .

1634
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
More than 100 delegates flew in from around the world to elect a successor .

1635
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
They could not agree , so asked her to stay on .

1636
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
She agreed .

1637
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
In 1991 , Mother Teresa was treated at a California hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia .

1638
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
In 1993 , she fell in Rome and broke three ribs .

1639
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
In August the same year , while in New Delhi to receive yet another award , she developed malaria , complicated by her heart and lung problems .

1640
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Last April she fractured her left collar bone .

1641
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But her increasing frailty , arthritis and failing eyesight has not stopped her travels around the world to mingle with the poor and desperate .

1642
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Mother Teresa was born Agnes Goinxha Bejaxhiu to Albanian parents in Skopje , in what was then Serbia , on August 27 , 1910 .

1643
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
She attended a government school and was already deeply religious by the time she was 12 .

1644
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
At the age of 18 she became a Loretto nun , hoping to work at the Order 's Calcutta mission .

1645
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
She was sent to Loretto Abbey in Dublin and from there to India to begin her novitiate and teach geography at a convent school in Calcutta .

1646
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
She said her divine call to work among the poor came in September , 1946 . "

1647
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
The message was quite clear , " she told one interviewer . "

1648
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them .

1649
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It was an order .

1650
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I knew where I belonged . "

1651
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
The Vatican and the mother superior in Dublin approved and after intensive training as a nurse with American missionaries she opened her first Calcutta slum school in December 1949 .

1652
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
She took the name of Teresa , after France 's Saint Therese of the Child Jesus .

1653
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
In India she was simply called Mother .

1654
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Mother Teresa set up her first home for the dying in a Hindu rest house in Calcutta after she saw a penniless woman turned away by a city hospital .

1655
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Named " Nirmal Hriday " ( Tender Heart ) , it was the first of a chain of 150 homes for dying , destitute people , admitting nearly 18,000 a year .

1656
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Her Missionaries of Charity , a Roman Catholic religious order she founded in 1949 , now runs about 300 homes for unwanted children and the destitute in India and abroad .

1657
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
In 1994 a British television documentary called the myth around Mother Teresa a mixture of " hyperbole and credulity " .

Media baron Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp Ltd reported lower than expected 1995/96 profits on Thursday , but forecast that the hit film " Independence Day " would help increase profits by at least 20 percent in 1996/97 .

1663

" From an earnings perspective , the current fiscal year has begun with great promise due to the hit motion picture ' Independence Day , ' " News Corp said in a statement announcing its results for the year to June 30 , 1996 .

1664
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It said moderating paper prices and solid orders for advertising at its Fox Broadcasting television network in the United States would also help boost profits in the 1996/97 year . "

1665
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
A budgeted profit increase of at least 20 percent for the full year currently appears very attainable , " News Corp said .

1666
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The bullish comments for the coming year soothed analysts and most shareholders , who were disappointed by the lower than expected profit for 1995/96 .

1667
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
News announced pre-abnormals net profit for the year fell six percent to A$ 1.26 billion ( US$ 995 million ) and earnings per share dropped to 40 cents from 46 cents .

1668

1670
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
News Corp said strong performances in U.S. television and British newspapers were offset by lower profits from News Corp 's magazine and publishing divisions and further hefty losses from its Asian Star TV operations .

1671
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Higher newsprint prices hit profits hard . "

1672

Throughout the group , higher paper prices increased costs by over US$ 300 million , " it said .

1673
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
News Corp said British newspaper operating profits rose 10 percent for the year , as higher cover prices at The Sun and The Times and higher advertising volumes offset increased newsprint costs .

1674
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Advertising revenues at The Times grew 20 percent .

1675
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Analysts said sharply lower earnings from News Corp 's book publishing division and its U.S. magazines had been the major surprises in the results for 1995/96 .

1676
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
News Corp said revenue gains at its magazines and inserts division were offset by higher paper prices and lower sales at the U.S. TV Guide .

1677
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
News said dramatically lower earnings from the British arm of its Harper-Collins publishing division more than offset healthy results from its U.S. operation .

1678
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It said the demise of the Net Book Agreement had hurt the British operations , and weak performances from the San Francisco unit of Harper-Collins had not helped .

1679
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
The minimum price setting expired last September when three publishers pulled out .

1680
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But it was the bullish profit forecast for 1996/97 that took the spotlight in the market , with some analysts saying 20 percent may even be an understatement .

1681
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
" If they 're saying at least 20 percent , then their internal forecasts are probably saying 25 or 30 percent , " said one Sydney media analyst who declined to be named .

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Ukraine celebrates five years of independence from Kremlin rule on Saturday , hailing civil and inter-ethnic peace as its main post-Soviet achievement .

1808
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Ukraine 's declaration of independence in 1991 , backed nine-to-one by a referendum in December of that year , effectively dealt a death blow to the Soviet empire and ended more than three centuries of rule from Moscow .

1809
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Ukraine , with a Russian community of 11 million people -- the world 's largest outside Russia -- has avoided conflicts like those in Russia 's Chechnya , neighbouring Moldova , and the former Soviet republics of Georgia , Azerbaijan and Tajikistan .

1810
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
" Ukraine 's biggest achievements for five years are the preservation of civil peace and inter-ethnic harmony , " President Leonid Kuchma said in televised statement this week .

1811
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
" Unlike many other post-Soviet countries we were able to deal with conflict situations in a peaceful and civilised way . "

1812
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But independence was initially accompanied by hyper-inflation and economic collapse , although there are signs of a turnaround .

1813
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Inflation -- a hyper-inflationary 10,300 percent a year in 1993 -- was a respectable 0.1 percent a month in June and July and the economy has just begun to grow .

1814
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Kuchma told a solemn ceremony at the Ukraina Palace on Friday that " there was a turning point " in reforms and that he expected a rise in the standard of living in the near future .

1815
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
" There is no doubt that economic growth has already started , " said Adelbert Knobl , head of the International Monetary Fund 's mission in Ukraine . "

1816
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
The national bank and the government have every reason to be proud of their efforts . "

1817
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Central bank officials said on Thursday that a much-postponed hryvna currency would " definitely " be introduced before the end of this year .

1818
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It will replace the interim karbovanets currency , which was introduced at par to the Russian rouble in 1992 but now trades at almost 33 karbovanets per rouble .

1819
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Ukraine has repeatedly promised to introduce the hryvna but had to postpone the plans because of economic problems .

1820
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Proud of its record in promptly joining both the Council of Europe and NATO 's Partnership for Peace , Ukraine caused a foreign policy wrangle this week , offending China by allowing a Taiwanese minister to appear on a public , if unofficial visit .

1821
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
China cancelled a visit by a top-level delegation in protest .

1822
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Kiev 's Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko said Beijing was overreacting .

1823
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
But Ukraine , seeing itself as a bridge between Russia and the rapidly Westernising countries of eastern Europe , is looking West as well as East .

1824
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
" The strategic aim of European integration should not in any way damage Ukraine 's interests in post-Soviet areas .

1825
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Relations with Russia , which is our main partner , have great importance , " Kuchma said .

1826
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
" But Ukraine cannot be economically oriented on Russia , even though those in some circles push us to do that . "

1827
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Kuchma has said Kiev wants membership of the European Union , associate membership of the Western European Union defence grouping and to move closer to NATO .

1828
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
A message from the West this week from U.S. President Bill Clinton congratulated Ukraine on the anniversary , promising to support market reforms and praising Ukraine as a " stabilising factor " in a united Europe .

1832
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Gazeta Shqiptare said the " Book of Mass ' , by Gjon Buzuku , dating from 1555 and discovered in 1740 in a religious seminary in Rome , was the first major document published in the Albanian language .

1833
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
" We Albanians , sons of Buzuku , believed our language had a written document but now we do not have it any more , " lamented scholar Musa Hamiti , told of the loss by the Vatican library .

1834

" We have always been concerned about barter deals with other countries , viewing them as a disguised kind of capital flight from Russia , " Marina Volkova , deputy head of the currency department at the State Customs Committee , told Reuters .

1840
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Volkova said last year goods had been exported under many Russian barter deals , with nothing imported in return .

1841
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
She said the cost of such unimported goods was $ 1.10 billion in 1995 .

1842
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Barter deals were worth $ 4.9 billion last year , or about eight percent of all Russian exports estimated at $ 61.5 billion , she said .

1843
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
" The cost of exported goods is too often understated , so the actual share of barter deals in Russian exports and the amount of unimported goods may be even higher , " Volkova said .

1844
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
A few days ago Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree on state regulation of foreign barter deals , and Volkova said this " could substantially improve the situation " .

1845
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
In line with the decree , which will come into force on November 1 , all Russian barter traders will be obliged to import goods worth the cost of their exports within 180 days .

1846
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
" If traders are late , they will have to pay fines worth the cost of their exported goods , " Volkova said .

1847
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Understating the cost of exported goods could still be a loophole for barter dealers , but Volkova said the authorities are currently " tackling the technicalities of the issue " .

1848
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Barter has always been a feature of the Soviet Union 's foreign trade , but Yeltsin 's decrees liberalising foreign trade in 1991-1992 has given barter a new impetus .

1849
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
A few years ago , barter deals accounted for up to 25-30 percent of Russian exports because " thousands ( of ) trade companies which popped up preferred barter in the absence of reliable Russian banks and money transfer systems " , Volkova said .

1850
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
" Now many Russian banks are strong and can make various sorts of money tranfers , while incompetent traders are being ousted by more experienced ones .

1851
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
But the current share of barter deals in Russian exports is still high , " she said .

LOS ANGELES 1996-08-22

1855
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Paramount Pictures is going ahead with a sequel to the Tom Cruise blockbuster , " Mission : Impossible " and hopes to release it in the summer of 1998 , Daily Variety reported in its Friday edition .

1856
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
The big-screen version of the spy TV series has grossed $ 175 million domestically since opening May 22 , and $ 338 million overseas so far .

1857
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It 's the biggest success for Viacom Inc-owned Paramount since 1994 's " Forrest Gump " .

1858
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
However , many critics complained its plot was incomprehensible .

1859
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Cruise will reprise his roles as star and co-producer , and will soon meet Academy Award-winning screenwriter William Goldman , who will write the script , the report said .

1860
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It said " Mission : Impossible " director Brian De Palma would have first crack at the sequel , though no deals have been made yet .

1861
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Goldman , whose Oscars were for " Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid " and " All the President 's Men " , earlier this summer criticised some of the season 's blockbusters .

1862
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
However , he singled out " Mission : Impossible " as an especially entertaining movie , Daily Variety said .

England batsman John Crawley was forced to endure a frustrating delay of over three hours before resuming his quest for a maiden test century in the third test against Pakistan on Friday .

1866
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Heavy overnight rain and morning drizzle ruled out any play before lunch on the second day but an improvement in the weather prompted the umpires to announce a 1415 local time ( 1315 GMT ) start in the event of no further rain .

1867
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Crawley , unbeaten on 94 overnight in an England total of 278 for six , was spotted strumming a guitar in the dressing-room as the Oval ground staff took centre stage .

1868
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
There were several damp patches on the square and the outfield and it was still raining when the players took an early lunch at 1230 local time ( 1130 GMT ) .

1869
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
When brighter weather finally arrived , the umpires announced a revised figure of 67 overs to be bowled with play extended to at least 1900 local time ( 1800 GMT ) .

1990
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
LONDON 1996-08-23

1991
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Middlesbrough 's Italian striker Fabrizio Ravanelli is to wear his team sponsor 's name on the inside of his shirt so it can be seen when he scores .

1992
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Every time he finds the net , the grey-haired forward pulls his shirtfront over his head as he runs to salute the fans , and Middlesbrough 's sponsors want to cash in on the spectacle .

1993
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
" Having seen Ravanelli celebrate his goals ...

1994
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
we thought it would be fun to have ( the name ) on the inside of his shirt , " a spokesman for the sponsors said .

1995
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
" It will give the fans something else to look at besides his chest . "

1996
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Ravanelli aggravated a foot injury in the 1-0 defeat at Chelsea on Wednesday and was given only an even chance of playing at Nottingham Forest on Saturday by his manager Bryan Robson .

1997
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
TENNIS - AUSTRALIANS ADVANCE AT CANADIAN OPEN .

1998
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
TORONTO 1996-08-22

1999
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It was Australia Day at the $ 2 million Canadian Open on Thursday as three Aussies reached the quarter-finals with straight-set victories .

2000
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Unseeded Patrick Rafter recorded the most noteworthy result as he upset sixth-seeded American MaliVai Washington 6-2 6-1 in just 50 minutes .

2001
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Todd Woodbridge , who defeated Canadian Daniel Nestor 7-6 ( 7-2 ) 7-6 ( 7-4 ) , and Mark Philippoussis , a 6-3 6-4 winner over Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic , also advanced and will meet in Friday 's quarter-finals .

2002
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Third-seeded Wayne Ferreira of South Africa defeated Tim Henman of Britain 6-4 6-4 after a three-hour evening rain delay and fifth-seeded Thomas Enqvist of Sweden won his third-round match , eliminating Petr Korda of the Czech Republic 6-3 6-4 .

2003
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Ferreira and Enqvist play in a Friday night quarter-final .

2004
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Two Americans , seventh seed Todd Martin and unseeded Alex O'Brien , will meet on Friday after winning matches on Thursday .

2005
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Martin overcame Cedric Pioline of France 2-6 6-2 6-4 and O'Brien beat Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden 6-3 2-6 6-3 .

2006
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
" If you really look at the match , " said the 12th-ranked Washington after losing to the 70th-ranked Rafter , " I never really got a chance to play because he was serving big and getting in close to the net .

2007
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
" He was also able to handle my serve pretty easily because my ( first ) service percentage was only in the 40s .

2008
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Put those two things together and you get a loss . "

2009
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Rafter missed 10 weeks after wrist surgery earlier this year and the time away from tennis has given him a new perspective .

2010
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
" Before when I was on tour , I always felt I had to be in bed by 9:30 or 10 o'clock and I had to be up at a certain time , " Rafter said . "

2011
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Now I can go to bed at at midnight or wake up at seven in the morning .

2012
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I just do n't have as many set routines and it 's made me a happier person . "

2013
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Martin was pleased with his victory over Pioline , his first in five meetings with the 11th-ranked Frenchman . "

2014
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It 's always difficult to win a match when you lose the first set , especially against someone you have never beaten , " he said .

2015
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
" I got more aggressive in the second and third sets and the wind picked up and that also affected things because Cedric definitely went off a little bit . "

2016
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
The 26-year-old O'Brien , who won the ATP Tour stop in New Haven last week , has now won 18 of his last 20 matches , dating back to qualifying rounds in Los Angeles in late July .

2017
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
He ranks 76th after being 285th four weeks ago .

2018
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
" I feel I 'm hitting the ball well even though I 'm having more mental letdowns than I did last week , " O'Brien said . "

2019
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
But I 'm still competing well . "

2020
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
" I got a lot of first serves in , " said Enqvist about his victory over Korda . "

2021
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I did n't miss that many shots and he was making the mistakes . "

2022
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Still marvelling at an exciting 64-stroke rally he won in the last game of his second-round match against Javier Sanchez of Spain on Tuesday , Enqvist joked , " Today against Petr there were about 64 strokes in the whole match .

2023
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It was mostly short points . "

2047
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Centre Japie Mulder has been ruled out of South Africa 's team for the second test against New Zealand in Pretoria on Saturday .

2048
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Mulder missed the first test in Durban with back spasms and failed a fitness check on Thursday .

2049
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
But new Springbok skipper Gary Teichmann has recovered from a bruised thigh and is ready to play , coach Andre Markgraaff said .

2050
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Mulder 's absence means that Northern Transvaal centre Andre Snyman should win his second cap alongside provincial colleague Danie van Schalkwyk .

2051
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Wing Pieter Hendriks is expected to retain his place , following speculation that Snyman would be picked out of position on the wing .

2052
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
The line-up would not be announced until shortly before the start , Markgraaff said .

2065
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
NEW YORK 1996-08-23

2066
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Promising 10th-ranked American Chanda Rubin has pulled out of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships with a wrist injury , tournament officials announced .

2067
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
The 20-year-old Rubin , who was to be seeded 11th , is still suffering from tendinitis of the right wrist that has kept her sidelined in recent months .

2068
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Rubin 's misfortune turned into a very lucky break for eighth-seeded Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport .

2069
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Davenport had drawn one of the toughest first-round assignments of any of the seeded players in 17th-ranked Karina Habsudova of Slovakia .

2070
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But as the highest-ranked non-seeded player in the tournament , Habsudova will be moved into Rubin 's slot in the draw , while Davenport will now get a qualifier in the first round , according to U.S. Tennis Association officials .

2071
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Rubin is the third notable withdrawal from the women 's competition after 12th-ranked former Australian Open champion Mary Pierce and 20th-ranked Wimbledon semifinalist Meredith McGrath pulled out earlier this week with injuries .

2072
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000

2239
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Russia 's double Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova smashed her second world record in just 10 days on Friday when she bettered the mark for the women 's 1,000 metres .

2240
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
After breaking the world record for the women 's mile in Zurich last Wednesday , the Olympic 800 and 1,500 metres champion clocked two minutes 28.98 seconds over 1,000 at the Brussels grand prix meeting .

2241
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
The Russian ate up the ground in a swift last lap to shave 0.36 seconds off the previous best of 2:29.34 set by Mozambique 's Maria Mutola in the same stadium in August last year .

2242
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Former world 800 champion Mutola pushed Masterkova all the way , finishing second in 2:29.66 .

2243
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
But it was the Russian who picked up the bonus of $ 25,000 for the historic run in front of a capacity 40,000 crowd .

2244
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Masterkova dominated the middle-distance races at the recent Atlanta Games following her return to competition this season after a three-year maternity break .

2245
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
In her first mile race at the richest meeting in Zurich last Wednesday , she slashed 3.05 seconds off the previous record .

2246
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
The record of four minutes , 12.56 seconds in Zurich earned Masterkova a bonus of $ 50,000 plus one kilo of gold .

2247
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
After Friday 's performance the Russian will have earned well over $ 100,000 in less than a fortnight , taking her appearance money into account .

2248
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Brussels organisers had laid a new track for the meeting comparable to the surface at the Atlanta Games but put down on a softer surface .

2249
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Masterkova clearly enjoyed it .

2250
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Mutola looked threatening in the final 200 metres but the Russian found an extra gear to power home several strides ahead , pointing at the time on the clock with delight as she crossed the line .

BRUSSELS 1996-08-23

2292
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
American Dennis Mitchell upstaged a trio of past and present Olympic 100 metres champions on Friday with a storming victory at the Brussels grand prix .

2293
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Sporting his customary bright green outfit , the U.S. champion clocked 10.03 seconds despite damp conditions to take the scalp of Canada 's reigning Olympic champion Donovan Bailey , 1992 champion Linford Christie of Britain and American 1984 and 1988 champion Carl Lewis .

2294
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Mitchell also beat world and Olympic champion Bailey at the most lucrative meeting in the sport in Zurich last week .

2295
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
The American , who finished fourth at the Atlanta Games , was fast out of his blocks and held off Bailey 's late burst in the final 20 metres before heading off for a lap of celebration .

2296
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The Canadian was second in 10.09 with Lewis third in 10.10 , ahead of Atlanta bronze medallist Ato Boldon who clocked 10.12 in fourth .

2297
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Christie , competing in what is expected to be his last major international meeting , finished fifth in 10.14 .

2298
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Lewis , making a rare appearance in Europe in a sprint race , left the track with a slight limp .

2299
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
American Olympic high hurdles champion Allen Johnson defied the wet conditions to produce a brilliant 12.92 seconds in the 110 metres race , just 0.01 outside the world record held by Britain 's Colin Jackson .

2300
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Johnson ran the same time at the U.S. Olympic trials in Atlanta in June to become the second equal fastest hurdler of all time with American Roger Kingdom .

2301
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
He seemed to relish the new track at the Brussels meeting , dominating the race from start to finish with a slight wind at his back .

2302
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Jackson , the only man to have run faster , could not live with his speed , taking second in 13.24 seconds .

2303
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
The rain was pelting down when the women 's high hurdlers stepped up for their 100 metres race .

2304
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But Sweden 's Olympic high hurdles champion Ludmila Engquist , who crashed out of last week 's meeting in Zurich after hitting a hurdle , also kept her footing perfectly to win in a fast 12.60 seconds .

2305
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Olympic silver medallist Brigita Bukovec of Slovenia could finish only fifth in the race in 12.95 .

2306
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Jamaican Commonwealth champion Michelle Freeman took second in 12.77 ahead of Cuban Aliuska Lopez .

2307
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
The Zurich fall cost Engquist a shot at a jackpot of 20 one-kg gold bars which can be won by athletes who clinch their events at all of the Golden Four series in Oslo , Zurich , Brussels and Berlin .

2308
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Seven athletes went into Friday 's penultimate meeting of the series with a chance of winning the prize and American men 's 400 metres hurdles champion Derrick Adkins kept his hopes alive in the competition by winning his event in 47.93 .

2309
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
American Olympic champion Gail Devers clocked a swift 10.84 seconds on her way to victory in the women 's 100 metres , the second fastest time of the season and 0.10 seconds faster than her winning time in Atlanta .

2310
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Jamaican veteran Merlene Ottey , who beat Devers in Zurich after just missing out on the gold medal in Atlanta after a photo finish , had to settle for third place in 11.04 .

2311
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
American world champion Gwen Torrence , the bronze medallist in Atlanta , was second in 11.00 .

2312
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It was a costly defeat for Ottey since it threw her out of the race for the Golden Four jackpot .

The U.S. and Colombian governments reached an agreement that will allow AMR Corp 's American Airlines to operate three round-trip flights between New York and Bogota , the Department of Transportation said Friday .

2640
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Under the agreement , which followed talks in Miami this week , AMR also will be allowed to shift up to four of the weekly flights it now operates between Miami and Colombia to its New York gateway .

2642
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Colombia was permitted to add a single additional round-trip flight to its current New York service , although it will not be able to do so while under Category Two ( Conditional ) status under the Federal Aviation Administration 's International Aviation Safety program .

2643
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Colombia would be allowed to add new service when its safety assessment has been improved , the department said .

2644
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
With the exception of the new services just agreed to , the governments of the two nations have agreed to maintain their current level of routes and airlines for the next 2-1/2 years , the agreement said .

2645
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
The agreement resolved a dispute that arose in June when Colombia turned down American 's request to operate flights between New York and Bogota , a denial that prompted the United States to charge that the Colombians were breaking a bilateral aviation agreement and to propose sanctions against one of two Colombian airlines , Avianca and ACES .

The club , founded in 1961 , has a loyal following in Taibe , an Arab town of 28,000 in the heart of Israel .

2703
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
But away from their home ground , they face unfriendly crowds who taunt the players with racist abuse .

2704
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
" The very first thing we thought about after we knew we would be promoted was the game against Betar Jerusalem , " said Taibe supporter Karem Haj Yihye .

2705
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Two weeks ago Taibe , coached by Pole Wojtek Lazarek , met Betar , a club closely associated with the right-wing Likud party , for the first time in a Cup match in Jerusalem .

2706
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Chants from the crowd of " Death to the Arabs " , and bottle-throwing during the game marred the match which ended in a goalless draw .

2707
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
One Taibe supporter required hospital treatment for cuts and bruises after a stone struck his head as he was driving from the stadium .

2708
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
" We 're used to hearing the taunts of " Death to the Arabs ' , " said Sameh Haj Yihye , a Taibe resident who studies at Jerusalem 's Hebrew University . "

2709
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
But we know that these are only words , nobody has died from hearing them and it only makes us support our team more vehemently . "

2710
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
The dusty town of Taibe lacks the amenities of Jewish communities and many Israeli Arabs have long complained of state discrimination .

2711
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
" There are no parks or empty areas of land around here , so when we want to play a friendly game of soccer we all load up in the car and travel to Tel Aviv , " 60 km ( 36 miles ) away , Sameh Haj Yihye said .

2712
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
The town 's ramshackle 2,500-seat ground is accessible only by two dirt tracks .

2713
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
" We plan to build a 10,000-seat stadium , but it may well be situated elsewhere , " said club chairman Abdul Rahman Haj Yihye . "

2714
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
We will discuss this with the mayor and hopefully a new or refurbished ground will be completed by the start of the new year . "

2715
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
In the meantime , Taibe will play all their heavily policed home matches at the Jewish coastal town of Netanya .

2716
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
" We are Israelis , there is no question about that , " said Karem Haj Yihye , a hotel waiter .

2717
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
" We do n't have any connection with the Palestinians , they live over there , " he said , pointing to the West Bank seven km ( four miles ) to the east .

2718
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
" We do n't feel our club represents Palestinian Arabs , " said club chairman Abdul Rahman . "

2719
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
We are trying to do all we can to run a professional outfit , we are pleased at any support we get , but do not go out looking to represent the whole Arab world . "

2733
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
They have not lifted a European Trophy since 1991 when they beat Barcelona in the Cup Winners ' Cup final , and their one and only European Cup triumph was way back in 1968 , when they beat Benfica of Portugal 4-1 at Wembley .

2734

2774
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
The Russian army said earlier it was preparing to withdraw from the rebel-dominated southern mountains of the region as part of the peace deal reached with separatists on Thursday .

2775
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
" There has been some shooting from their side but it has been relatively quiet , " said fighter Aslan Shabazov , a bearded man wearing a white t-shirt and camoflage trousers .

2777
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
The separatists , who swept into Grozny on August 6 , still control large areas of the centre of town , and Russian soldiers are based at checkpoints on the approach roads .

The truce , the latest of several , was agreed in talks on Thursday between Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov .

2781
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000

The main Friday prayers in southern Jordan that were the starting point for the riots a week ago passed peacefully under tight security imposed by the army with only brief demonstrations reported .

Adel Ibrahim , the Iraqi embassy 's press attache , was asked to leave " because he was carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms " , one source told Reuters , implying he was accused of spying .

Ibrahim told Reuters by telephone from his embassy office in Amman that he " had not been notified " of any explusion order .

The government declined official comment .

2822
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Ibrahim 's assistant , Hussein Khalaf , was expelled earlier this year for similar reasons amid rising tension in bilateral ties after King Hussein began calling for change in Baghdad following top Iraqi defections in August 1995 .

2823
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Iraq retaliated then by expelling a junior administrator working in the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad but has continued its policy of trying to avoid public conflicts with Jordan -- its only secure route to the rest of the world .

2859

LONDON 1996-08-23

2943
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Implied volatility of European bond and interest rate options should stabilise around current levels until early next week after falling before and after this week 's German-led cut in interest rates , traders said .

2944
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
" Volatility has come off a lot .

2945
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
We 're looking for it to stabilise now , " said one Euromark options trader at a U.S. bank .

2946
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
A trader at a Japanese bank said Euromark volatility now stood at 14.00 for September contract , 16.75 for December , 19.50 for March and 21.25 for June .

2947
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
This compared with midweek levels , before the welter of interest rate cuts , of 18.50 for September , 20.00 for December , 22.00 for March and 23.5 for June , he said .

2948
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
At 1347 GMT , December Euromark futures were trading at 96.78 , two basis points down on the day .

2949
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
He said the sell-off in June vols might have been overdone , which could offer value at current levels .

2950
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
He said caps and floors would be well bid after the round of interest rate cuts due to the fact these rates should stay low at the short end .

2951
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
The size of the Bundesbank 's repo rate cut , to 3.00 percent from 3.30 percent , took markets by surprise .

2952
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
" Volatility has a bid to it -- longer-dated volatility more than short-dated because the event people were buying for has passed and now perhaps people will sell some short dated vol and buy some long dated vol , " he said .

2953
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
" Long dated volatility has been low this year , so it is still at levels which are not historically high .

2954
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
" It is not a dangerous level to own vol. You are not going to lose a lot and you could make quite a bit . "

2955
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
He said volatility levels should be stable until markets reassess the situation after a long weekend in Britain .

2956
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Paribas Capital Markets OTC options specialist Robert Coughlan said that if volatility continued lower for the rest of Friday in over-the-counter 10-year Bunds , it should be higher next Tuesday .

2957
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
He said the absence on holiday of many market makers was a main factor behind falls this week in volatility in high-yielding markets such as Italy , Spain and Sweden .

2958
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Coughlan said the market had more downside than upside potential , but a fall was not likely to be of significant size .

2959
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
" I recommend people sell strangles in a number of markets -- in Germany and France in particular .

2960
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000

Legal challenge to Diana delayed by jail term .

2974
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
LONDON 1996-08-23

2975
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
A British photographer branded a stalker by Princess Diana has been forced to postpone a legal challenge to a ban on approaching her because he 's been jailed for criminal damage , his lawyer said on Friday .

2976
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Martin Stenning started a 12-week jail sentence on Thursday just as he was preparing to contest an injunction obtained by Diana banning him from coming within 300 metres ( yards ) of her .

2977
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
" We were in the process of preparing a detailed affidavit responding to the Princess 's affadavit and expected to go to court in the next couple of weeks , " said Stenning 's lawyer , Benedict Birnberg . "

2978
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
But everything has been put on ice now . "

2979
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Birnberg told Reuters that the challenge to the injunction would be delayed until Stenning was released .

2980
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Stenning threw a brick through the window of a van in February after an argument with a driver when he was working as a motorcycle dispatch rider .

2981
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Stenning , who has previous convictions , is expected to appeal against the sentence .

2982
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Magistrates also ordered him to pay compensation of 182 pounds ( $ 282 ) .

2983
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
The freelance photographer was branded a stalker by Diana , whose divorce from heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles is due to become final next week , after persistently trailing her on his motorcycle .

2984
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
In an affidavit , the princess said that in chasing her Stenning had got so close that he twice smashed into her car and pushed her when she tried to remove the film from his camera .

2985
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Stenning has rejected Diana 's claims and said he was being made a scapegoat to scare off press photographers .

Jordan has asked an Iraqi diplomat to leave the kingdom for carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms , an official source said on Friday .

2989
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
The move came after Amman blamed Iraq and a pro-Baghdad local political party for last week 's worst unrest in seven years after a government decision to double prices of bread .

2990
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
The government declined comment .

2991
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
" Jordan has asked Mr. Adel Ibrahim , the Iraqi embassy 's press attache , to leave because he was carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms , " the source told Reuters .

2992
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
He said Ibrahim was still in Amman .

2993
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
The Jordanian Arab Socialist Baath Party has denied involvement in unrest which it blamed on government policies and rising economic hardship .

2994
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000

Turkish Kurd guerrillas said on Friday they would free seven Turkish soldiers they hold in northern Iraq under a tentative Islamist peace bid .

2998
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
" ...For the sake of safety we are asking for their family members or the authorities to come and pick them up , " Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) central committee member Riza Altun told journalists near the Iraqi city of Dohuk .

2999
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
PKK guerrillas would accompany the soldiers , captured last spring in one of Turkey 's frequent cross-border drives , until they could be handed over , he said .

3000
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Their release has been negotiated by Islamist writer Ismail Nacar as part of a wider effort , partly backed by Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan , to find a political solution to Turkey 's Kurdish problem .

3001
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Erbakan has encouraged Nacar 's bid but has ruled out direct talks with the rebels .

3002
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
The PKK often uses bases in northern Iraq in its fight for autonomy or independence in southeast Turkey .

3003
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
More than 20,000 people have died in 12 years of fighting between the guerrillas and Turkish forces .

A consortium of telephone companies and The Walt Disney Co .

3018
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
said Thursday it had signed a $ 1 billion contract with Zenith to make digital televison set-top boxes for its home entertainment service .

3019
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
The announcement of the contract for 3 million set-top boxes gave new hope to Zenith , which has struggled with years of losses .

3020
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
" This really indicates we 're back in the business , " William Luehrs , president of the Glenview , Ill.-based company 's Networks Services Division , said in a telephone interview . "

3021
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Anytime somebody gets the opportunity to enter the next era with such a big bang has got to be seen as a strong message to the industry . "

3022
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Following the announcement , Zenith 's stock soared $ 5.50 to $ 16.875 on the New York Stock Exchange .

3023
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
The consortium , called Americast , said the contract was part of its strategy to develop and market the next generation in home entertainment .

3024
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
In addition to Disney , Americast 's partners are phone companies Ameritech Corp. , BellSouth Corp. , GTE Corp. and SBC Communications .

3025
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Americast said Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. has signed a letter of intent to join the group , which plans to provide a home entertainment service similar to cable television .

3026
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Zenith also said it planned to build a new $ 100 million plant in Woodridge , Ill .

3027
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
, to make picture tubes for 32- and 35-inch screen TV sets .

3028
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
The company currently buys the tubes from competitors .

3029
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
The new plant , which is dependent on obtaining financing , will create about 280 new jobs , Zenith said .

3030
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
The contract calls for production of the set-top boxes over five years .

3031
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Luehrs said manufacturing will begin and revenue will start to roll in during the first half of next year .

3032
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
The boxes will be made on a build-to-order basis .

3033
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Zenith will convert its Chihuahua , Mexico , analogue set-top box plant to manufacture the digital boxes .

3034
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Luehrs declined to say when the operation was expected to be profitable .

3035
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Americast will provide the boxes to subscribers as part of the service .

3036
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Its service is being introduced in selected markets across the United States .

3037
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Luehrs said digital technology in set-top boxes is only the beginning and said the technology will eventually show up in retail consumer electronics .

3038
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
" We 'll build a lot of these devices into television sets , for digital television , " he said . "

3039
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Although that is not where this particular contract is headed , the fact that there is a strong Zenith presence will pay us dividends in the future . "

3040
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Zenith has been plagued by generally soft conditions in the colour television industry , reporting full-year losses since 1989 .

3041
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Last month , it reported a second-quarter loss of $ 33.2 million , or 51 cents a share , vs. a loss of $ 45.3 million , or 97 cents a share , a year earlier .

3042
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Last November , South Korea-based LG Electronics Inc. bought a majority stake in Zenith .

3043
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Robert Gutenstein , an analyst for Kalf , Voorhis & Co .

3044
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
, said the contract was " not unique , but it 's big . "

3045
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
" Digital is coming , it 's economic and the question is what will make the consumer happy and at what price . "

WASHINGTON 1996-08-22

3048
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
From the people who brought you hundreds of " yogic fliers " who claimed to defy nature by levitating comes The Natural Law Party , a minor political party that nominated a presidential candidate on Thursday .

3049
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
At a hotel convention here , the party associated with the Transcendental Meditation ( TM ) movement named physicist John Hagelin as its presidential nominee for the Nov. 5 election .

3050
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
The party is running on a platform claiming it can ward off problems before they occur through techniques such as mass meditation that would reduce stress , crime , terrorism and even wars .

3051
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
" Social stress can be reduced and problems such as crime and violence will automatically decrease , " said a party paper .

3052
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Many party members are practitioners of TM , which involves meditating to a repeated word or phrase , called a mantra .

3053
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Some advanced TM followers contend they can actually mediate to such a point that they fly .

3054
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
But in a demonstration of " yogic flying " several years ago , critics said the people were merely bouncing off the ground from a sitting position .

Huge Windows 95 sales fail to meet expectations .

Martin Wolk

3057
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
SEATTLE 1996-08-22

3058
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
A year after its massively publicized introduction , Microsoft Corp. 's Windows 95 computer operating system has fallen short of the most optimistic expectations for the software giant and the industry .

3059
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Even though more than 40 million copies of Windows 95 have been sold , making it the fastest-selling new software ever , it would have been impossible for any product to live up to the unprecedented hype of the Aug. 24 , 1995 launch , when stores around the world opened at midnight to greet long lines of customers .

3060
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
The Redmond , Wash.-based company spent tens of millions of dollars promoting the product with stunts that included buying the entire print run of the Times of London and lighting New York 's Empire State building in a Windows color scheme .

3061
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
But the product , delivered eight months late , has fallen short of its sales potential in part because Microsoft delivered a mixed message to business customers , analysts said .

3062
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
" It did n't do as well as it could have , " said Rob Enderle , an analyst with Giga Information Group .

3063
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Scores of software and hardware companies that had hoped for a big boost in sales were disappointed when only a brief spike materialized .

3064
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
" People who were expecting major coat-tails were somewhat disappointed , " said Scott Winkler , an analyst with Gartner Group .

3065
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
" It 's not as though it has n't had an impact , " he said . "

3066
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
It just has n't had the huge earth-shattering impact some people were looking for . "

3067
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Symantec Corp. , which had been among the most bullish of software companies at the time of the Windows 95 launch , ended up posting disappointing financial results when retail sales of the operating system fell short of its projections .

3068
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Touchstone Software Corp. had to pay $ 1.3 million in cash and stock to settle a shareholders lawsuit brought after the company 's sales failed to meet expectations tied to the Windows 95 launch .

3069
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Many software developers apparently saw their crucial holiday season sales suffer last year because store shelves were jammed with blue-and-white boxes of Windows 95 , resulting in a shortage of space for seasonal products , said Ann Stephens , president of PC Data Inc .

3070
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
To be sure , sales of Windows 95 and the accompanying Office 95 upgrade drove Microsoft sales up 46 percent last year to a record $ 8.67 billion and cemented the company 's status as the industry 's dominant company .

3071
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Microsoft executives say they are thrilled with the sales figures , and industry analysts estimate that by sometime next year , the installed base of Windows 95 will surpass that of the older version of Windows , now used on about 100 million computers worldwide .

3072
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
But Enderle said the figure could have been even higher if Microsoft had done a better job of handling the huge demand for technical support from customers who were frustrated trying to install the system .

3073
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
He and other analysts said corporate America adopted a go-slow approach because Microsoft already was promoting the new version of its high-end Windows NT operating system , expected to be available in stores in the next several weeks .

3074
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
" Microsoft sent a lot of signals that NT was going to be the answer , " Winkler said . "

3075
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Many people began to believe that Windows 95 was being downplayed . "

3076
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
But now that Windows NT 4.0 has been launched , Winkler and others believe only a relatively small proportion of corporate users will elect to pay the added software and hardware costs needed to use it instead of Windows 95 .

3077
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
" Windows 95 is going to do great , " he said . "

3078
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
The mistake people made was in thinking it was going to be a fast , sweeping change rather than a slow , building change . "

U.S. says still committed to Cuba migration pacts .

3080
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
WASHINGTON 1996-08-22

3081
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
The United States said on Thursday it remained committed to migration accords with Cuba and would continue to repatriate intercepted Cuban migrants who attempted to enter U.S. territory illegally .

3082
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
A State Department statement appeared in part a response to Cuban complaints that Washington was jeopardising the accords by failing to return some of the Cubans involved in recent illegal migration incidents .

3083
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
" The United States reiterates its full commitment to the implementation " of the accords signed by the two countries in 1994 and 1995 , said the statement by spokesman Glyn Davies .

3084
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
" The United States will continue to return Cuban migrants intercepted at sea who seek to enter the United States or the Guantanamo Naval Base illegally , " it said .

3085
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Washington would also take " prompt and effective law enforcement action " against alien smuggling and hijackings from Cuba , it added .

3086
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Davies told reporters the statement would be distributed in the Cuban exile community in Miami " to remind everyone of the importance of abiding by the accords and avoiding dangerous attempts to cross the straits " from Cuba to Florida .

3087
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Havana 's complaints centred on an incident in which a boatload of emigrants capsized in the Florida Straits last week and two recent aircraft hijackings from Cuba .

Sixteen of those picked up from the boat were returned to Cuba but eight were taken to the United States and three to Guantanamo Bay , a U.S. base on Cuba , until they emigrated to another nation .

Tommy Thompson said Thursday .

3098
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
According to a new release from the governor , Wisconsin submitted a plan to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for administration of the new block grant system for welfare just minutes after President Bill Clinton signed the measure into law Thursday .

3099
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
" As the nation 's leader in welfare reform , Wisconsin is far ahead of the curve and ready to go under this new system , " Thompson said .

3100
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Still , the governor said the new law does not go as far as the state 's own welfare reform program , dubbed W-2 .

3101
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
He said that despite the new law , Wisconsin will still require federal waivers allowing the working poor to acquire health care coverage from the state , a 60-day residency requirement for participation in the welfare program , and child support collections to go directly to custodial parents .

3102
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
The nation 's new welfare reform law limits eligibility , gives states more power and ends direct federal aid for poor children .

Both churches were in the Mississippi delta region of Arkansas , about 90 miles ( 145 kms ) southeast of Little Rock , and were located within three miles of one another .

3124

3206
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
U.S. marine biologists have trained a pair of sea lions to tag and photograph elusive whales as they cruise through the Pacific depths , New Scientist magazine reported on Thursday .

3207
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
James Harvey and Jennifer Hurley of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in California say their sea lions , natural companions of many species of whale , can go where no man or woman has ever gone before .

3208
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
" Any diver knows that when a whale gets going you ca n't keep up , " Harvey told the magazine . "

3209
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
That is why we know only about five percent of what whales do . "

3210
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
The sea lions -- 17-year-old Beaver and nine-year-old Sake -- have undergone six years of training for their mission .

3211
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Beaver once worked for the U.S. Navy and Sake is an amusement park veteran .

3212
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Harvey said they could accurately tag whales with a radio transmitter , and could also swim all the way around one of the giant mammals , filming it with a video camera .

3218
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
" Every time the Senate hacks away at the budget , they hack away at the lower interest rate environment , " Howard told reporters on Thursday night after attending a Liberal Party function .

HONG KONG 1996-08-23

3276
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses , confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate , probably belongs to China 's strategic state reserve , industry sources said on Friday .

3277
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Around 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou , where some of the strategic stockpile was stored , they said .

3278
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp ( CNIEC ) in June and July .

3279
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
It was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve , administered directly by the central government 's State Planning Commission , owned the copper .

3280
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise .

3281
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
But one source , the head of a Hong Kong trading house , said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not .

3282
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
" If they spend all this money moving the copper to Yingkou , it will be sitting there for years , " he said .

3283
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
" Once it arrives in Yingkou , it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission , which has to give permission for any more movement ; it is out of the hands of traders , " he said .

3284
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Mystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months , with traders unsure not only of who owns it , but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it .

3285
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) .

3286
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price .

3287
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
CNIEC lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve , running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously .

3288
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Traders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US$ 2,700 a tonne , and then paid somewhere between $ 2,200 and $ 2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year .

3289
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
This would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit , which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs .

3290
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Word that CNIEC had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market .

3291
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Industry analysts Bloomsbury Minerals Economics ( BME ) said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 85,000 tonnes , " whoever they are , is the most important short-term fundamental " in an already tight world market .

3292
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
BME repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp , with CNIEC said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $ 1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals .

3293
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Sumitomo and CNIEC have made no comments on the talk and Chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement .

3294
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Traders in Shanghai said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the Shanghai bonded warehouses .

3295
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases .

3296
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
They also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market .

3297
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
But these concerns were irrelevant , a Singapore trader said , despite a forecast that domestic Chinese copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year .

3298
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
As with many commodities , " there is a desire ( by the Chinese government ) to keep a stockpile of the metal , " he said . "

You do n't keep it to help industry , you keep it in case of emergency . "

CRICKET - ESSEX POISED TO STEP UP TITLE CHALLENGE .

3535
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
LONDON 1996-08-24

3536
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Essex are set to step up their English county championship challenge with a fifth consecutive victory after new-ball pair Neil Williams and Mark Ilott sent Gloucestershire reeling on Saturday .

3537
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Williams seized two wickets in two deliveries and left-armer Ilott also captured two as Gloucestershire , 252 behind on first innings , slumped to 27 for four at the close on the third day of the four-day game at Colchester .

3538
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Essex , who started the current round of matches in fifth place 20 points behind leaders Derbyshire with a game in hand , could go top if they complete victory on Monday 's last day and other results favour them .

3539
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Williams thrust Essex on course for success by dispatching Matt Windows and Andrew Symonds in his second over , before Ilott removed Dominic Hewson and Tim Hancock to reduce Gloucestershire to 17 for four at one stage .

3540
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
The visitors had started the day optimistically by sending back former England captain Graham Gooch when he added just six to his overnight 105 , but Essex went on to make 532 for eight before declaring .

3541
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Captain Paul Prichard plundered 88 from 73 deliveries , hitting 15 fours and one six .

3542
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Second-placed Kent were frustrated by rain which prevented any play at Cardiff , where they have reached 255 for three in their first innings against Glamorgan , while third-placed Surrey are facing an uphill task against Nottinghamshire .

3543
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Surrey slipped to 88 for four in reply to Notts ' commanding first innings of 446 for nine declared at Trent Bridge , before Alistair Brown struck a 55-ball half-century .

3544
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Brown 's 56 not out , containing eight fours and three sixes , lifted Surrey to 128 for four on a rain-curtailed day .

3545
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Fourth-placed Leicestershire had Hampshire on the ropes at Leicester before rain intervened .

3546
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Pace trio David Millns ( 2-24 ) , Gordon Parsons ( 3-20 ) and Vince Wells ( 2-19 ) had Hampshire reeling at 81 for seven in reply to the home county 's first innings of 353 .

3547
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Yorkshire rekindled their title hopes after three successive defeats by taking the upper hand against arch-rivals Lancashire at Old Trafford .

3548
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Facing Yorkshire 's 529 for eight declared , Lancashire were forced to follow on 206 behind after being bowled out for 323 , paceman Darren Gough polishing off the innings with a burst of three wickets for one run in 17 deliveries .

3549
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Lancashire then reached 210 for five at the close -- just four ahead -- after Neil Fairbrother hit 55 in 60 balls to add to his first innings of 86 .

3910
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Dutch champions Ajax Amsterdam faltered in their second league match of the season on Saturday losing 2-0 away at Heerenveen .

3911
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Ajax , who had a dismal series of pre-season results before beating NAC of Breda in their opening game , had the best of an entertaining first half but failed to break the deadlock .

3912
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Eight minutes after the interval , Heerenveen 's Romeo Wouden broke through the Amsterdam defence , left defender John Veldman standing and curled the ball beyond goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar into the Ajax net .

3913
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Ajax , without injured defenders Marcio Santos and Winston Bogarde and strikers Jari Litmanen and Marc Overmars , then stepped up the pace and looked certain to equalise .

3914
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
But they left gaps at the back and on 73 minutes Danish striker Jon Dahl Tomasson rushed out of his own half , beat the Ajax defence and lobbed van der Sar .

3915
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
The defeat means Ajax 's main title contenders PSV Eindhoven , who beat the champions 3-0 in the traditional league curtain-raiser , can go three points clear of their rivals if they beat Groningen on Sunday .

LONDON 1996-08-24

4122
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
A British aid worker , held hostage in Chechnya for nearly four weeks , said on Saturday a cocked Kalashnikov had been thrust into his mouth at one point during his ordeal .

4123
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Michael Penrose , a 23-year-old worker with the group Action Against Hunger , described his ordeal to a news conference when he arrived back in Britain from Moscow .

4124
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
" The worst period of physical manhandling was during that time when we were beaten with Kalashnikovs and at one point I had a Kalashnikov held to the back of my throat -- cocked , " he said .

4125
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
" For the first period we were held in a small room with no bed or anything .

4126
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
We had very little food and sometimes went two or three days without eating . "

4127
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Gunmen seized Penrose , who comes from Swerford in southern England , Frenchman Frederic Malardeau and six other hostages from their car in Grozny , the capital of Chechnya , on July 27 .

4128
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
The assailants had demanded a ransom of 300,000 pounds ( $ 465,000 ) but no money was paid by the charity when they were released on Wednesday .

4129
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
The hostages were held in a house in or near Grozny which was bombarded regularly .

4130
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
" During the last 15 days of being held , the fighting in Grozny was very close .

4131
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
At first it was street fighting outside the house and then we came under very heavy shelling and bombardment from conventional weapons like tanks , artillery and grenade launchers , " he said .

4132
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Penrose had been working for the charity which provides food to civilians for only a few weeks before he was captured .

4133
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
When asked if he would return to the mountainous region where rebels have been fighting Russian troops for full independence , Penrose said : " Not for the time being .

4134
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I do n't think it 's safe for me .

4135
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
But maybe in the future , depending on the circumstances . "

Princess Diana send message to Mother Teresa .

4137
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
LONDON 1996-08-24

4138
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Britain 's Princess Diana has sent a message to seriously ill Mother Teresa , the nun to whom she has turned several times for spiritual guidance .

4139
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Diana 's office said on Saturday the princess had sent a message to the Nobel Peace Prize-winning missionary as news broke this week of her battle against heart problems and malaria .

4140
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
A spokeswoman declined to release details of the message .

4141
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Diana first met the Albanian-born missionary in Rome in 1992 .

4142
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
She said afterwards that the meeting had fulfilled her " dearest wish " and the two women have met several times since .

4143
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
The princess , who has carved out a major role for herself as a helper of the sick and needy , is said to have turned to Mother Teresa for guidance as her marriage crumbled to heir to the British throne Prince Charles .

4144

I think it will be more physically challenging and we 'll have to go up against more diverse situations due to the terrain , " said Dr. Michael Stroud , a veteran Eco-Challenge participant .

4168

HARARE 1996-08-24

4195
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
The Zimbabwean government fired thousands of workers on Saturday for defying an order to end a strike which has crippled essential services and disrupted international and domestic flights .

4196
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
The Public Service Commission ( PSC ) said in a statement that the workers -- including nurses , junior doctors , mortuary attendants , customs officers and firefighters -- would be barred from entering their workplaces on Monday .

4197
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
" All civil servants who did not return to work at their normal working hours , and remained working for the full working day on 23 August 1996 , have been summarily dismissed ...

4198
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
with immediate effect , " it said in a statement .

4199
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Union officials from the Public Service Association ( PSA ) were unavailable for comment .

4200
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Public Service , Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro told state radio her ministry had already begun recruiting other people to replace the strikers , sub-contracting some of the work to private firms .

4201
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
The government had been threatening to fire the workers since the strike began on Tuesday , saying it was illegal .

4202
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
But the strikers ignored the threat and vowed to stay on the streets until their demands for wage rises of 30 to 60 percent were met .

4203
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
The stoppage has left essential services stretched with many hospitals handling only emergency cases under senior doctors with the help of army medical personnel and the Red Cross .

4204
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
It has also disrupted flights .

4205
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Some internal services were cancelled , leaving tourists at the Victoria Falls resort stranded , and flights abroad were delayed .

4206
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
The PSA said 80 percent of the country 's 180,000 civil servants took part in the strike which is a rare challenge to President Robert Mugabe , who has been in power since independence from Britain in 1980 .

4207
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Opposition parties , civic organisations and private-sector unions have expressed support for the action and denounced the government 's pay rises of up to eight percent for its workers .

4208
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Civil servants earn on average Z$ 1,000 ( $ 100 ) a month .

4209
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
They say their pay has not kept up at all with inflation , currently running at 22 percent .

4212
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Rwanda said on Saturday that Zaire had expelled 28 Rwandan Hutu refugees accused of being " trouble-makers " in camps in eastern Zaire .

4213
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Captain Firmin Gatera , spokesman for the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan army , told Reuters in Kigali that 17 of the 28 refugees handed over on Friday from the Zairean town of Goma had been soldiers in the former Hutu army which fled to Zaire in 1994 after being defeated by Tutsi forces in Rwanda 's civil war .

4214
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo said on Thursday in a visit to Rwanda that his country would expell all the refugees back to Rwanda but he gave no timeframe .

4215
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Zaire is home to 1.1 million Rwandan Hutu refugees who fled three months of civil war in 1994 .

4216
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Many had taken part in the genocide that year of one million people , mostly Tutsis , and refuse to go home for fear of reprisal at the hands of the new Tutsi-dominated government in Kigali .

4217
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Gatera said the refugees were handed over following a deal made at a meeting between the governor of Zaire 's north Kivu region and his counterpart in the Rwandan border town of Gisenyi .

4218
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
" After a meeting between the governor of north Kivu and the prefect of Gisenyi , 28 prisoners ( refugees ) were handed over to Rwandan authorities on Friday , " Gatera said . "

4219
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Out of these 17 were former soldiers .

4220
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
These people are now in Gisenyi prison , " Gatera added .

JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-24

4223
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
A limelight-loving South African chief was in disgrace on Saturday after a prized skull he brought home from Scotland was identified as belonging not to his sacred tribal ancestor , but to a middle-aged white woman .

4224
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
A forensic scientist who examined the supposed skull of 19th century King Hintsa , a chief of President Nelson Mandela 's Xhosa tribe killed in battle by the British , said it was in fact the cranium of a European woman .

4225
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Chief Nicholas Gcaleka , dressed in animal skins and full tribal regalia , journeyed to a wintry Scotland in February on a hugely publicised quest to find Hintsa 's skull .

4226
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
The witchdoctor said ancestors had appeared to him in a dream and ordered him to return the head , said to have been carried off as a colonial trophy by the officer who shot and allegedly beheaded Hintsa after a battle in 1835 .

4227
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
But Gcaleka ran into trouble as soon as he returned to South Africa with a skull he found in a cottage in a lonely Highland forest near Inverness .

4228
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
He said the spirit of a hurricane had guided him there .

4229
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Members of the Xhosa royal family , branding Gcaleka a charlatan , confiscated the head and sent it for tests to a forensic scientist , who examined the shape of the skull and the hole that he determined had not come , as supposed , from a bullet .

4230
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
" It can be stated beyond reasonable doubt that this skull is not that of the late king , " the scientist said in a statement .

01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Sudanese police have arrested three people trying to smuggle sewing machines and army clothing to Sudanese opposition groups in Eritrea , an official newspaper reported on Saturday .

4234
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
The government-owned al-Ingaz al-Watani said the smugglers were caught in Banat in the eastern state of Kassala , on the border with Eritrea , and had confessed they were on their way to " the so-called alliance forces which have been undertaking subversive operations on the eastern border " .

4235
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Authorities in Kassala said opposition forces based in Eritrea have been laying landmines and stealing vehicles and other goods to smuggle them across the border into Eritrea .

4236
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Sudan accuses the Eritrean authorities of providing support to Sudanese opposition elements based in Eritrea .

4237
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Eritrea cut diplomatic ties with Sudan in 1994 , accusing it of training rebels to make raids into Eritrea .

4238
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
The exiled National Democratic Alliance , a Sudanese umbrella opposition group , has its headquarters in the Eritrean capital Asmara .

Albania 's opposition Socialist Party began a two-day congress on Saturday to discuss major jettisoning its links with almost half a century of Stalinist dictatorship in the Balkan country .

4243
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
" The congress will approve new concepts that will turn the party into a Social-Democratic and electoral party , not a class and ideological one , " the Socialist Zeri i Popullit daily said in an editorial .

4244
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Jailed Socialist leader Fatos Nano made the first call for change in July , a month after the party 's chief opponents , the conservative Democrats of President Sali Berisha , almost swept the board in a disputed general election .

4245
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
The Socialists , reformed heirs to the communists , pulled out of the poll saying it was a sham .

4246
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Acting Socialist leader Servet Pellumbi has said he too will urge the party to scrap the ideas of Karl Marx at the congress .

4247
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
The pro-reform stance of some of the party leadership initially caused a storm and triggered the resignation last month of the party 's Secretary-General Gramoz Ruci .

4248
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
More recently political commentators have reported a growing consensus , however , and a rift at the meeting looks increasingly unlikely .

4258
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000

01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Tunisia 's main opposition party on Saturday announced that it had been ousted from its headquarters building by a court decision for failing to pay the rent .

4276
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Mohamed Ali Khalfallah , spokesman for the Movement of Socialist Democrats ( MDS ) said that a bailiff who was accompagnied by policemen , on Saturday ordered the party to leave the building .

4277
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
" We were not allowed a delay to enable us to transfer the movement 's goods and documents , " Khalfallah added in a statement .

4278
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
The building is state property .

4279
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
The MDS was represented in court and admitted owing money for rent but did not give details .

4280
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
MDS this year lost its president and vice-president , both of whom were tried and given jail sentences .

4281
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
MDS president Mohamed Moada was sentenced last February to 11 years in jail on charges of having secret contacts with Libyan agents and receiving money from Tripoli .

4282
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Vice-president Khemais Chammari last July was sentenced to five years in prison on a charge of disclosing secrets of judicial proceedings in Moada 's affair .

4283
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
To replace Moada , the MDS after the trial named Khalfallah as " coordinator " but Ismail Boulahya , the last of the MDS founding members still politically active , claimed the title of president , causing a new split within the movement .

4284
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
MDS was founded in 1978 by a group led by Ahmed Mestiri , who withdrew from politics in 1992 .

4285
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Succeeding him as head of the movement , Moada , an Arab nationalist , ousted liberals led by MDS secretary-general Mustapha Ben Jaafar in 1993 .

4288
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
An Iraqi Kurdish guerrilla group on Saturday accused Iraqi government forces of killing two civilians in shelling in northern Iraq , the Iranian news agency IRNA reported .

4289
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
IRNA said it was monitoring a report from a radio station affiliated to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) .

4290
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
" Iraqi army heavily shelled the Kanie Karzhala camp , west of Arbil , on Friday ...

4291
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Two civilians were killed in the Iraqi bombing , " IRNA quoted the radio report as saying .

4292
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
The PUK-run radio on Friday said Iraqi heavy artillery was pounding its positions in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq but it gave no details of casualties .

4293
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
There was no independent confirmation of the reports .

4294
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
The rival Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) , which accuses Iran of supporting the PUK , said on Thursday that its forces had halted an Iranian-backed attack by thousands of PUK fighters .

4295
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
The United States said in Washington on Friday that it had brokered a ceasefire to end six days of fighting between the two main Kurdish factions and persuaded them to attend U.S.-mediated peace talks next month .

4296
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
The clashes , shattering a ceasefire negotiated last year by Washington , had threatened a U.S.-led peace plan to unite the Kurdish region against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein .

4297
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
U.S. , British and French planes have been patrolling the skies of northern Iraq since shortly after the 1991 Gulf War to shield Iraq 's Kurds from any attack by Iraqi troops .

Iran has accused Iraq of violating the ceasefire ending their 1980-88 war some 32 times between the end of March and May 31 this year , the Iranian news agency IRNA reported on Saturday .

4301
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Iran 's deputy representative to the United Nations , Majid Takht Ravanchi , made the allegations in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Friday , the agency said .

4302
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
" The Islamic Republic of Iran has reported some 32 new cases of ceasefire violations by the Iraqi regime between March 31 and May 31 , 1996 , " it reported from New York .

4303
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
It said violations included constructing observation posts , installing mortars and anti-aircraft cannons , setting up tents , penetrating Iranian territory , and firing rifle grenades towards Iranian territory .

4304
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
The eight-year war between the two countries ended with a U.N.-sponsored ceasefire .

WASHINGTON 1996-08-24

4325
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
President Bill Clinton has served notice he intends to be busy " making news " -- or at least doing things that look and sound like it in a campaign year .

4326
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
With Democrats gathering in Chicago to start a convention on Monday to nominate him for a second term as president , Clinton plans a steady parade of events designed to highlight his leadership and dim the glow of the just-concluded Republican conclave that gave a boost to rival Bob Dole .

4327
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
After a week of carefully orchestrated events signing into law bills passed by the Republican-controlled Congress , Clinton used his Saturday radio address to the nation to proudly " announce " a development in the war on crime .

4328
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
" Sixty days ago I directed the attorney general to draw up a plan for a national registry of sex offenders , " Clinton said . "

4329
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
That plan has now reached my desk . "

4330
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
" Today I am pleased to announce that we are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals , not just in a single state but wherever they go , " he said .

4331
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Actually , creation of such a registry was underway without Clinton lifting a finger .

4332
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Attorney General Janet Reno 's report -- all nine pages of it , including footnotes -- offers only the interim services of the FBI until a formal registry on sex offenders has been established .

4333
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Two months ago , Clinton announced he wanted an interim effort established .

4334
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Now , 60 days later , he had a chance to talk about it again .

4335
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
It is an example of Clinton 's strategic planning as he heads into the stretch drive for the Nov. 5 presidential election .

4336
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Such things do not happen by chance in the Clinton White House , they are part of his political chess game .

4337
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
In the past week Clinton signed into law an increase in the minimium wage , a bill that makes it easier for someone with a pre-existing health problem to change jobs , and sweeping changes overhauling the nation 's welfare system .

4338
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
" America can look back on a week of remarkable achievement , " Clinton said , without even a passing reference to the Republican majority in the House and Senate .

4339
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
" America is on the right track offering more opportunity , demanding more responsibility , building a stronger community , the sense of shared values and stronger families , " he said in striking the theme of his coming week .

4340
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
According to a senior campaign official , Clinton " will be making a lot of news in the coming week -- something different each day . "

4341
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Clinton departs on Sunday on a four-day train trip through West Virginia , Kentucky , Ohio , Michigan and Indiana while fellow Democrats are gathered in Chicago .

4342
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
" He 'll make news during the day ... and then at night the attention will go to the convention , " said the campaign official . "

4343
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
We think it 'll work really well . "

4344
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Although officials decline to say just what each day 's " news " will be , the intent is to put a focus on Clinton himself and not just those attending the party 's convention .

4345
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Each day of the trip will have a late start , so that network television correspondents will be able to do live reports for morning programmes .

4346
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Campaign officials then hope the day 's " news " event will be showcased on evening television news shows as a lead-in for that night 's convention programme .

4347
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
" We 'll be concentrating ... on supporting the president as he is on the trip and making significant public policy statements related to some of his plans for the future , " said White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry .

4348
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
McCurry said that when Clinton delivers his acceptance address on Thursday night to fellow Democrats and a national television audience , he will " set out a road map " for the nation 's future -- one the president hopes guides him back to the White House for four more years .

Hurricane Edouard grew stronger on Saturday as it swirled across the Atlantic Ocean , but forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said the storm would likely swing north and miss the Caribbean .

4352
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
" Edouard is getting stronger and stronger , and it already has winds of 105 mph ( 185 kph ) , " said hurricane forecaster Lixion Avila .

4353
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
" But the good news is that all our computer models indicate Edouard is going to turn to the west-northwest on Sunday and miss the islands , " he added .

4354
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
At 11 a.m. EDT ( 1500 GMT ) , Edouard was 1,130 miles east of the Lesser Antilles and moving west at 14 mph ( 25 kph ) .

4355
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000

Ignacio Olascoaga Mugica , who had just ended a prison sentence in France , is suspected of having taken part in several guerrilla attacks in Spain .

BONN 1996-08-24

4363
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Defence Minister Volker Ruehe said that German troops would stay on in Bosnia next year as part of an international force to ensure the establishment of peace , a newspaper reported on Saturday .

4364
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
The current NATO-led peace force ( IFOR ) in Bosnia is due to return home at the end of the year .

4365
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
But Ruehe told Bild am Sonntag in an interview that a " new and different mandate " for the troops would be agreed on for next year after the current mandate expires in December .

4366
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
" After the ( Bosnian ) elections ( on September 14 ) the troops will start being reduced from the beginning of October from 60,000 to about 20,000 .

4367
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
A completely new and different mandate will be agreed for next year , " Ruehe said .

4368
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
" The defence ministers will begin negotiations for this at the beginning of September at a NATO meeting , " he told the newspaper in an interview , excerpts of which were released ahead of publication on Sunday .

4369
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
" But we must avoid giving the impression this peace deployment in former Yugoslavia is being perceived in the long run as an occupation .

4370
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
On the other hand we must prevent any return of war and massacres " he said .

Italian comics hope independence-joke 's on Bossi .

4372
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
ORVIETO , Italy 1996-08-24

4373
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
A group of Italian comics hope the joke will be on separatist leader Umberto Bossi next month when they lead the ancient Etruscan town of Orvieto in a mock split from Rome .

4374
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Orvieto mayor Stefano Cimicchi said the comics , including popular actor Roberto Benigni , would declare Orvieto " capital of Etruria " on September 15 -- the day Bossi plans a march across the north in favour of independence from Rome .

4375
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
" We will then proceed with the annexation of Sardinia , Corsica and Cyprus , " Cimicchi told reporters on Saturday .

4376
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
He said the city council would be " ironically present " when the comics made their proclamation on the same day Bossi has threatened to declare the birth of Padania , the name he has given to northern Italy .

4377
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Orvieto , located in Umbria between Rome and Florence , was once the capital of Etruria , an ancient federation of 12 Etruscan towns .

4378
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
" We want to pop some air out of this balloon of tension that has been blown up around September 15 , " Cimicchi said .

4379
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
" We want to help turn down the rhetoric in a country that borders former Yugoslavia yet in which people are still talking about secession , " he added .

4380
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Bossi has intensified his separatist rhetoric since his Northern League party 's good showing in last April 's general election , when it took 10 percent of the vote nationally .

4381
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
He has recently dropped a drive for federalism , saying secession from Rome 's wasteful and centralised bureaucracy is the only solution for northerners .

Italian farmer says he mutilated four women .

VERONA , Italy 1996-08-24

4384
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
An Italian farmer accused of multiple homocide has confessed to mutilating the bodies of four women after having sex with them , the Italian news agency ANSA reported on Saturday .

4385
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
It quoted the lawyer of Gianfranco Stevanin as saying the 35-year-old farmer confessed on Friday to a Verona magistrate that he had killed and mutilated the women .

4386
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
ANSA said Stevanin was unable to recall how he had killed the women , remembering only that he had found them " lifeless in his arms " after having sadmasochistic sex with them .

4387
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Stevanin , arrested in 1994 and jailed for three years for assaulting an Austrian prostitute , is accused of murdering five women , three of whose bodies were found near his villa outside Verona between July and December 1995 .

4388
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Two of the corpses were identified but not the third , found headless and decomposed in a sack in a nearby canal .

4389
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Lawyer Cesare dal Maso told ANSA that Stevanin confessed to beheading and dumping the body of a fourth woman in the nearby Adige river .

4390
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Dal Maso declined to comment on the alleged fifth murder , saying only that " the interrogations are not over yet " with investigators .

4391
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
It said investigators believed Stevanin had suffocated them by putting plastic bags on their heads .

4392
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Stevanin was first sentenced for assault but investigators began digging in the garden of his villa after the first body was found by a passer-by .

4396
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Belgian police searched two more houses on Saturday for bodies in a child-sex scandal of murder , kidnapping and pornography that has sent a shockwave of revulsion throughout Europe .

4397
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Recriminations built up over how the scandal 's central figure , convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux , managed to prey on children unhindered for so long .

4398
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
In just over a week two young girls have been found dead , from starvation , two have been freed from a dungeon-like secret compartment and an international hunt has started for at least two others .

4399
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
On Saturday investigators with dogs trained to find bodies searched one house at Ransart and one at Mont-sur-Marchienne -- both suburbs of the southern city of Charleroi .

4400
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Both houses are owned by Dutroux .

4401
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Belgian media speculated that Dutroux , charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children , must have had high level protection to molest youngsters .

4402
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
They put forward no proof to support the speculation , but seized on a comment by chief prosecutor Michel Bourlet on Belgian television on Friday night that he would chase down everyone involved in the case " if I am allowed to " .

4403
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Bourlet said between 300 and 400 paedophile porn video tapes had been seized , some of which featured Dutroux .

4404
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Dutroux was charged a week ago after police rescued two young girls from a concrete dungeon in the basement of one of the six houses he owns in and around Charleroi .

4405
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Just a day later the national euphoria at the rescue turned to disgust as Dutroux led police to the bodies of two eight-year-old girls in another of his houses .

4406
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo , had been kidnapped in June last year .

4407
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Dutroux said they starved to death nine months later .

4408
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
He also admitted kidnapping two other girls , An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks , a year ago .

4409
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
The fate of the girls is unknown , but there has been speculation they were sold into prostitution in Slovakia or the Czech Republic where Dutroux was a frequent visitor .

4410
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Belgian police have visited Bratislava and will visit Prague .

4411
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Five other people have been arrested including Dutroux 's second wife Michelle Martin , charged as an accomplice .

4412
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
The others have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children or are suspected of criminal association .

4413
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Dutch police are also holding a 74-year old Dutchman in connection with the disappearance of An and Eefje , although a spokesman said no direct link had yet been established .

4414
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
At least part of the speculation in the Belgian media of high-level protection for Dutroux and his accomplices is based on leaked documents cataloguing a high degree of police bungling , incompetence and indifference .

4415
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Among the revelations are the fact that the gendarmerie was running a surveillance operation codenamed " Othello " against Dutroux in 1995 -- when both Julie and Melissa and An and Eefje were kidnapped .

4416
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
They show that the gendarmes were aware that Dutroux was building cells in some of his houses for holding children , yet this information was either not passed on to other police forces searching for the missing girls or was overlooked when it was .

4417
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
They also show that police investigating a theft visited Dutroux late last year at the house where Julie and Melissa were being held but accepted his word that the children 's cries they could hear came from neighbours .

4418
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck has admitted that mistakes were made and ordered an inquiry at the same time as stressing there were no indications of a cover-up .

4419
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
There is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how Dutroux , an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support , managed to own six houses .

4420
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Death toll of Algeria bomb put at seven-newspaper .

PARIS 1996-08-24

4422
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
An Algerian newspaper on Saturday put at seven -- two women and five children -- the death toll of a bomb blast in a market west of Algiers on Friday .

4423
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Algerian security forces said on Friday three women and two children were killed and five people wounded when a home-made bomb exploded at a market in the coastal town of Bou Haroun , 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of Algiers .

4424
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
The security forces also said a man carrying an explosive device also died after it went off prematurely .

4425
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
El-Watan paper said the blast killed seven -- a mother and her 25-year-old daughter , four young boys and a five-year-old girl .

4426
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Several people were also wounded , it said .

4427
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
The explosion was the latest in series of bomb attacks in Algeria 's four-year-old civil strife .

4428
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
The government-appointed watchdog , Human Rights National Observatory , was quoted this month by local newspapers as saying about 1,400 civilians have died in bomb attacks blamed on Moslem rebels in the past two years .

4429
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
An estimated 50,000 Algerians and more than 110 foreigners have been killed in violence pitting Moslem rebels against government forces since early 1992 , when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead .

VALLETTA 1996-08-24

4432
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Police in Malta said on Saturday they had seized 7.5 tonnes of cannabis concealed in a shipment of chilli sauce on its way from Singapore to Romania .

4433
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Police commissioner George Grech said the cannabis was found on Friday packed in 500 boxes hidden behind chilli sauce in a container that arrived at Malta Freeport a week ago .

4434
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
The container was on its way to Romania via the former Yugoslavia from Singapore and was the biggest drugs haul in Malta , police said .

4435
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
No street value was given for the cannabis .

4438
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
A Czech coach crashed and burst into flames on a southern Austrian motorway early on Saturday , killing one person and injuring 15 , police said .

4439
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Austrian television said the coach , which was carrying 45 , was en route from the Czech Republic to Italy when the accident occurred near Steinberg , 200 km southwest of Vienna .

MADRID 1996-08-24

4442
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Most Spaniards would support government talks with the illegal Basque separatist group ETA if the rebels renounced violence permanently , a survey published in daily El Mundo on Saturday said .

4443
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
While 57 percent of the population supported negotiations with ETA ( Basque Homeland and Freedom ) , 30 percent opposed it , the survey by the state-controlled Centre for Sociological Studies ( CIS ) found .

4444
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
But 80 percent said ETA had shown little interest in achieving peace in the Basque country when it offered a one-week truce in July while continuing to hold prison officer Jose Antonio Ortega Lara , kidnapped in January .

4445
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
The problem of terrorism had neither worsened nor improved since the conservative Popular Party ( PP ) came to power in May , according to 56 percent of those questioned , while 22 percent said it had worsened .

4446
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
The survey questioned 2,496 people between July 17 and 21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus two percent .

ISLAMABAD 1996-08-24

4449
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
At least 30 people have been killed and about 100 injured in the flood-hit Pakistani city of Lahore , newspapers reported on Saturday .

4450
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
They said 461 mm ( 18 inches ) of rain had drenched the Punjab provincial capital in 36 hours , turning streets into rivers , knocking out power , water and telephone services , disrupting air and rail traffic , and sweeping away houses and cars .

4451
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Newspapers quoted witnesses as saying they had seen bodies floating in the streets .

4452
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Among the dead were five members of the religious Jamaat-i-Islami party who drowned while trying to remove books from a basement library .

4453
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
They said thousands of people had been made homeless after a breach opened in the city canal , inundating residential areas .

4454
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Army troops were called in to evacuate residents of low-lying areas to higher ground .

4455
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Officials said the Ravi and Chenab rivers , which both flow through Punjab , were in high flood and emergency services backed by troops were on full alert .

Internet Startup funded to develop Java software .

4457
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif. 1996-08-25

4458
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
A small team of engineers from Sun Microsystems Inc. 's JavaSoft unit said Sunday they have formed a new company , dubbed Internet Startup , to build Java infrastructure software .

4459
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
The fledgling company , established in a ground-floor office here over the last two weeks , has received venture financing from Bessemer Venture Partners of Menlo Park , Calif ..

4460
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
David Cowan , Internet Startup founder and acting chief executive , is a general partner of Bessemer .

4461
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
The startup company 's acting chairman is Jim Bidzos , the president of RSA Data Security , a unit of Security Dynamics Technologies Inc. as well as chairman of VeriSign .

4462
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Internet Startup , which opened its doors with about half a dozen initial employees , combines experience at JavaSoft , Apple Computer Inc. , and Oracle Systems .

4463
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
" Java portends dramatic changes in the way we use the Internet , " said Hong Bui , vice president of engineering of the new company after serving as a senior engineer at JavaSoft .

4464
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Java is a computer programming language introduced by Sun Microsystems in mid-1995 which has immediately captured the attention of the industry for its ability to operate across virtually all computer system in a relatively secure manner .

4465
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Just last week , Sun Microsystems and the Silicon Valley venture capital giant Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers said they had completed financing of a $ 100 million fund managed by Kleiner Perkins to fund startups developing Java technologies .

4466
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Java has been licensed by nearly 50 organisations , ranging from Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. to the Taiwan government .

4467
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Prasad Wagle , another former senior JavaSoft engineer who is among the founding engineers at Internet Startup , said the new company aims to build software infrastructure using Java to make networked applications ubiquitious .

4468
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
One feature of the Java language is that small software programmes , known as " applets " because they are small applications , can be downloaded from the server computers at the centre of networks onto individual computers for use .

4469
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
In this model , individual computer users can always gain access to the latest programmes and do not need to store more software than they are currently using on their computers at any one time , also saving costs of memory and storage .

4470
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Chris Zuleeg , a veteran of Apple and a former JavaSoft marketing manager , is vice president of marketing at Internet Startup , whose Web site is www.internetstartup.com .

4471
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Bessemer has funded numerous Internet pioneers , including PSI Net , VeriSign and Individual .

GOLF - MICKELSON WINS FOURTH TITLE OF YEAR IN AKRON .

4473
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
AKRON , Ohio 1996-08-25

4474
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Phil Mickelson birdied two of the last three holes to win World Series of Golf by three strokes over Billy Mayfair on Sunday .

4475
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
It was the fourth tournament title this year for Mickelson , who shot an even-par 70 , after being tied for the lead with Billy Mayfair with three holes to play .

4476
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Along with Mayfiar at 277 for the tournament were Steve Stricker , who had a 68 , and Duffy Waldorf , with a 66 .

4477
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
" It was very hard to sleep last night because there was so much I could accomplish with this win , " said Mickelson , who had a three-stroke lead entering the third round . "

4478
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
This was a win I wanted very , very much . "

4479
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Mickelson 's victory gave him a 10 year exemption to the PGA Tour .

4480
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
The $ 378,000 first place check brings Mickelson back to the top of the money list with $ 1,574,799 won this year .

4481
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
" This is a major championship golf course , and for me to perform well on this style of course is a big step up for me in my career and my performance in future majors , " he said .

4482
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Mickelson three-stroke lead was cut to two when Mayfair birdied the course 's only easy hole , the par five second hole , while Mickelson three-putted for par from 25 feet .

4483
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
On the back nine Mickelson began driving erratically , and poor tee shots resulted in bogeys on the , eighth , 12th and 13th holes , bringing Mickelson back to four under par , tied with Mayfair , who had parred 14 straight holes after the birdie on no.2 .

4484
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Mickelson then set up a tap in birdie on the 16th , sending a wedge shot to 18 inches .

4485
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
He had another birdie on the 17th , where he his a 6-iron to six feet .

4486
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Mayfair bogeyed the 17th , missing a five foot par putt , and dropped from solo second place to a three way tie for second .

4487
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
It was the second successive year in which Mayfair has finished runner up in this tournament .

4488
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
He lost to Greg Norman in sudden death last year .

4489
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
The defending champion was in contention , two behind Mickelson for much of the day , until he bogeyed the 13th and 14th holes .

MOTORCYCLING - JAPANESE WIN BOTH ROUND NINE SUPERBIKE RACES .

4869
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
SUGO , Japan 1996-08-25

4870
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Teenager Yuuichi Takeda , racing in only his first season , outclassed the big names to win the first race in round nine of the world superbike championship on Sunday .

4871
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Takeda , 18 , showed poise far beyond his years to overtake Australian Ducati rider Troy Corser , last year 's championship runner-up , with four of the 25 laps left .

4872
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Honda 's Takeda was pursued past Corser by the Yamaha duo of Noriyuki Haga and Wataru Yoshikawa with Haga briefly taking the lead in the final chicane on the last lap .

4873
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
But Takeda found one more spurt of power to just take the flag first with Haga second and Yoshikawa third .

4874
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Haga had the consolation of recording the fastest lap at 147.159 kph .

4875
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Corser , who crashed during practice on Friday , limped in fourth , four seconds behind Takeda with championship leader Aaron Slight of New Zealand 11 seconds behind the winner .

4876
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
In the second race , Takeda again challenged strongly until the fifth lap from the end when he crashed while running second to eventual race winner Takuma Aoki .

4877
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Aoki , the elder brother of reigning 125cc world champion Haruchika , had a race-long duel with John Kocinski of the United States on a Ducati before taking the chequered flag .

4878
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Kocinski led for the early laps before he was passed first by Aoki , who recorded the fastest lap of 147.786 kph , and then by Takeda .

4879
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
With Takeda out of the race , Kocinski regained second place but he could not overtake Aoki .

4880
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Haga again was the unlucky rider finishing third ahead of Slight with Corser in 10th place .

4881
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
But the strong showing by the Japanese riders did not alter the championship table with Slight still leading on 280 points , followed by Corser with 269 and Kocinski with 254 .

CRICKET - POLLOCK CONCLUDES WARWICKSHIRE CAREER WITH FLOURISH .

4902
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
LONDON 1996-08-25

4903
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
South African fast bowler Shaun Pollock concluded his Warwickshire career with a flourish on Sunday by taking the final three wickets during the county 's Sunday league victory over Worcestershire .

4904
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Pollock , who returns home on Tuesday for an ankle operation , took the last three wickets in nine balls as Worcestershire were dismissed for 154 .

4905
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
After an hour 's interruption for rain , Warwickshire then reached an adjusted target of 109 with 13 balls to spare and record their fifth win in the last six games .

4906
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Warwickshire are currently in fourth position behind Yorkshire , Nottinghamshire and Surrey .

4907
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Yorkshire captain David Byas completed his third Sunday league century as his side swept clear at the top of the table , reaching a career best 111 not out against Lancashire .

4908
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Lancashire 's total of 205 for eight from 40 overs looked reasonable before Byas put their attack to the sword , collecting his runs from just 100 balls with three sixes and nine fours .

4909
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Yorkshire eventually reached their target with only four wickets down and 7.5 overs to spare .

4913
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000

01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
LONDON 1996-08-25

5044
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Chris Lewis did his best to forget his controversial omission from the England one-day squad on Sunday but could not prevent Pakistan reasserting their dominance in the final test at The Oval .

5045
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
A super piece of fielding by Lewis , dropped as a disciplinary measure after arriving only 35 minutes before the start on the fourth morning , provided the only bright spot for England as the touring team batted on to reach 413 for five at the interval , a lead of 87 .

5046
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
The solitary wicket to fall was Asif Mujtaba , run out for 13 attempting a second run to third man where Lewis was lurking with a point to prove .

5047
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
There seemed scant danger until the Surrey player swooped on to the ball and returned off balance to county team mate Alec Stewart who whipped off the bails .

5048
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Lewis , though , could not make similar waves with the ball as Salim Malik and Wasim Akram batted through the rest of the session with few alarms .

5049
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Wasim rattled along to 30 not out , outscoring his partner who was unbeaten on 24 at the break , although the weather was again threatening to play the dominant role .

5050
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Rain arrived just as the players left the field for lunch , forcing the ground-staff into action yet again .

5051
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
The weather delayed the resumption for over an hour , the umpires finally announcing play would start again at 1445 local time ( 1345 GMT ) .

In New York , Wally Whitehurst allowed two runs over seven innings for his first win in more than two years and Paul O'Neill 's three-run double snapped a sixth-inning tie as the New York Yankees held on for a 5-4 victory over the Oakland Athletics .

Whitehurst , promoted from Triple-A Columbus on Wednesday , allowed seven hits and struck out one without a walk .

5415
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000

5423
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000

SOCCER - CHAMPIONS PORTO KICK OFF SEASON WITH A DRAW .

5458
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
LISBON 1996-08-25

5459
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Portuguese champions Porto kicked off the season with a disappointing 2-2 home draw against Setubal and were lucky to squeeze in an equaliser in extra time .

5460
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Porto , who are fighting to take their third consecutive title this season , were 2-0 down until the 86th minute when a header by Mario Jardel found the net after a string of missed opportunities , including a penalty taken by top league scorer Domingos Oliveira in the 60th minute .

5461
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Domingos redeemed himself by netting the equaliser just into extra time .

5462
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Setubal , who put on a skilful counter-attack throughout the game , opened the scoring 16 minutes into the match when an unmarked Chiquinho Conde shot around Porto 's new Polish keeper Andrejez Wozniak .

5463
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Conde scored his second in the 70th minute .

5464
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Benfica , also playing their first game of the season at home , were held to a 1-1 draw by northern side Braga despite the fact that the visitors were reduced to 10 men in the 54th minute after Rodrigo Carneiro was sent off for a second bookable offence .

5465
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Benfica dominated the game but their lack of a first-class striker was apparent throughout and in the 30th minute they lost key Brazilian midfielder Valdo who suffered a light knee injury .

5466
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
He was substituted by Paulao .

5467
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Benfica finally opened the scoring in the 81st minute with a penalty taken by Helder after Luis Baltasar tripped up captain Joao Pinto under the referee 's nose .

5468
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Braga defender Idalecio gave his team their equaliser seven minutes from the final whistle with a header into the back of the net .

MILAN 1996-08-25

5478
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta gave Fiorentina the perfect 70th birthday present on Sunday with two goals that gave the Italian Cup winners a 2-1 Supercup victory over serie A champions Milan .

5479
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
The victory , coming on the eve of the founding of the Florence club in 1926 , also marked the first time since the pre-season trophy between the Cup winners and league champions was started in 1988 that the Cup winners had won .

5480
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Batistuta gave Fiorentina the lead in the 11th minute .

5481
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Sweden 's Stefan Schwarz picked him out with a lob to the edge of the box and Batistuta did the rest , chipping veteran defender Franco Baresi and scoring at the near post .

5482
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Montenegrin midfielder Dejan Savicevic equalised for the home team , weaving past a defender , checking and firing in a left-footed shot in the 21st minute that gave young Fiorentina goalkeeper Francesco Toldo little chance .

5483
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
The scored stayed level to the final minutes but with a penalty shoot out looming , Batistuta took charge .

5484
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
French international midfielder Marcel Desailly fouled the Argentine , whose coach at Boca Juniors before he joined Fiorentina in 1991 was new Milan coach Oscar Tabarez , and Batistuta rammed home the free kick from 30 metres out .

5485
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
The 83rd minute shot , curling over the defence and dipping in under the bar from the striker dubbed Batigol by adoring Fiorentina fans , was just reward for Fiorentina who looked a far more impressive team .

5486
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Milan 's player of the year George Weah missed a good first half opportunity but otherwise looked a little rusty while Italian team mate Roberto Baggio did not play due to injury .

5487
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
New Dutch signing Edgar Davids came on late in the second half as a Milan substitute but made little impact .

5488
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000

RUGBY UNION - All Blacks relive triumph .

5818
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
PRETORIA , Aug 25 - Captain Sean Fitzpatrick and his All Blacks revisited the test venue today to relive some of the magic moments of yesterday 's momentous rugby victory over South Africa , NZPA reported .

5819
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Most of the test 15 who beat the Springboks 33-26 to secure New Zealand 's first-ever rugby series in South Africa stood in the middle of the empty 50,000-seat Loftus Versfeld .

5820
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Magnificent , ' ' said Fitzpatrick , New Zealand 's most capped player and the world 's most capped forward .

5821
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
The players relived the moves and tries , the tackles and what might have been as the emotions of victory continued .

5822
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Zinzan Brooke , the only No 8 in test rugby to have scored a dropped goal when he kicked a three-pointer against England during last year 's World Cup , added a second to his name yesterday .

5823
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I was right here , ' ' he said standing at the spot where he had received the ball for the kick .

5824
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
The maul was there and I was going to go in but I thought I should hold off because we had the ball .

5825
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
When ( halfback ) Justin Marshall got the ball he was going to go on the openside where Jon Preston was so I emptied my lung at him to get the ball this way .

5826
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I just hit through and I was punching the air before the ball got there .

5827
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
It cost me a few bucks at the bar . '

5828
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
'

5829
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
The decision to attempt a dropped goal was a spontaneous one , Brooke said .

5830
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
It was just like the World Cup , the ball came and the chance was there . '

5831
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
'

5832
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Centre Frank Bunce said he had never felt so exhausted during a match .

5833
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
We were gutted and there was nowhere to hide , they just kept coming at you , ' ' he said .

5834
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I was gone in the first 20 minutes , completely exhausted , but you had no choice .

5835
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
There was just so much riding on it .

5836
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
It 's amazing just how big this ground was yesterday . '

5837
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
'

5838
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Two-try winger Jeff Wilson said he was so tired that he kept asking Bunce where he should be while defending .

5839
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
He told me I 'm buggered too so just hang in there ' , ' ' Wilson recalled .

5840
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
About 4000 New Zealander supporters were partying into the early hours of today in the South African capital .

5841
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Messages of goodwill continued to roll into the team hotel .

5842
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
All Blacks coach John Hart said Prime Minister Jim Bolger rang him today to offer his congratulations .

5843
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
He thanked us on behalf of the country , which is really nice for the team , and I understand we had tremendous support at home . '

South Africa 's truth commission begins issuing subpoenas this week in a bid to dig beneath the political rationales and find the sinister figures who have the blood of the country 's race war on their hands .

5901
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Leaders of the major parties involved , from right-wing whites to radical blacks , appeared before Archbishop Desmond Tutu 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission last week to paint the broad picture of their actions for or against apartheid .

5902
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Most , including former president F.W. de Klerk and African National Congress Deputy President Thabo Mbeki , offered apologies for any mistakes they had made and accepted broad responsibility for the actions of their foot soldiers .

5903
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
But none named those guilty of ordering or carrying out any of the gross violations of human rights which Tutu is investigating .

5904
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Human rights lawyer Brian Currin said the hearings last week were not intended as a form of confessional and that those who personally committed crimes during apartheid would testify only before a separate arm of the commission , the amnesty committee .

5905
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
" I do n't think one should have expected more than what one got , " he said . "

5906
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
That was not the amnesty committee where perpetrators are expected to open their hearts and souls and to tell it all . "

5907
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
The commission , which has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess to abuses , has begun hearing the testimony from people already in jail for their deeds .

5908
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
But others , such as self-confessed secret police hit-squad leader Dirk Coetzee , have yet to testify .

5909
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Tutu 's deputy chairman , Alex Boraine , told reporters the commission would begin issuing subpoenas to suspects who refused to appear voluntarily some time this week .

5910
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
He added that former hardline apartheid president P.W. Botha could be among those called .

5911
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
But Currin , who is advising several people regarded as perpetrators , said this was not the best way to achieve the commission 's aims .

5912
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
" A person can be forced to appear , but the only way one is going to get to the truth in its totality is if people feel it is a good idea to go to the amnesty committee .

5913
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
At the moment this is not the case . "

5914
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
He cited Coetzee , who was charged with murder after confessing in media interviews to dirty tricks .

5915
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
His trial is due to start in December but the truth commission intends to decide on his amnesty application before that .

5916
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Currin said the law had to be changed so all judicial prosecutions were automatically suspended for those who approached the truth commission .

5917
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Last week 's submissions to the commission by the ANC , de Klerk 's National Party and the right-wing Freedom Front of General Constand Viljoen left many South Africans unsatisfied .

5918
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Boraine said the picture was incomplete because officers of the apartheid-era security forces had yet to make their scheduled , separate submission , but one black caller to a radio talk show declared :

5919
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
" This whole thing is utterly useless , it does n't help us at all .

5920
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
What the people expect is to have houses , to have jobs . "

5921
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Political scientist Jannie Gagiano said he doubted that the National Party , which implemented apartheid in 1948 and began dismantling it in 1990 , felt it carried a burden of guilt and needed to be exculpated through the commission .

5922
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,000
" Therefore I have some doubts about achieving some form of reconciliation .

5923
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
One has to feel a bit guilty to feel the need for reconciling yourself to a historical adversary , " he said .

5924
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Professor Tom Lodge of the University of the Witwatersrand demurred , saying :

5925
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
" In the irritation , in the jokes , in the anger that white South Africans express about the commission , I think there 's a moral uneasiness , and I think that 's healthy .

5926
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Responsibility is percolating downwards . "

MATUZICI , Bosnia 1996-08-25

5930
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Thousands of Moslem refugees denounced Bosnia 's elections as a farce on Sunday because Serb incomers would be able to vote in their old home town , cementing partition of the country .

5931
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
They said they were ready to force their way back across post-war ethnic lines to Serb-held Doboj , one of several towns where NATO troops fear violence involving refugees determined to vote where they once lived .

5932
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
The refugees , rallying in Matuzici on government territory two km from Doboj in northeast Bosnia , waved banners calling the polls a farce staged by the United Nations and the European Union . "

5933
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
We demand to vote in Doboj , " other banners said .

5934
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Bosnia 's Moslem-led central government and many displaced Moslems are angered by a key provision of the Western-organised September 14 elections allowing people to vote in post-war " new places of residence . "

5935
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
As a result , separatist Serb authorities have packed former Moslem majority towns with refugees of their own or registered other Serbs to vote there .

5936
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Critics say that what was billed as an electoral process to reintegrate Bosnia as a single , multi-ethnic state is shaping up as a referendum on partition , de facto or de jure .

5937
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
" Only our physical presence in Doboj will mean that the Dayton peace treaty has truly been implemented , " Edhem Efendija Camdzic , Doboj 's Islamic imam-in-exile , told the refugees .

5938
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
" The main point of this rally is to highlight to the world powers what misfortune they brought upon us , " said Reuf Mehemdagic , head of Doboj municipality-in-exile .

5939
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
" Eleven thousand Serbs who came from elsewhere to Doboj will vote there .

5940
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
How can we then expect the reintegration of Bosnia ?

5941
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
But no one will stop us from returning to our homes . "

5942
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Mirhunisa Komarica , a government refugee official , said : " We want to vote where we were thrown out from .

5943
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
This is a protest of warning and the next step is entering our town using all means possible , so let them shoot . "

5944
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic , a Moslem , told the refugees : " We have a message for the Serbs who are now in our homes not to plan the future of their children there because there will be no good fortune in that . "

5945
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
To loud applause , he added : " We will enter Doboj , untie the Doboj knot and ensure free movement for all .

5946
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
We have to enter Doboj to free the Serbs from their own ( separatist ) politics . "

5947
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
The Dayton peace accords guaranteed refugees the right to return to their homes and ensured freedom of movement across ethnic lines .

5948
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
But local police , controlled by nationalist parties in Moslem , Serb and Croat sectors of Bosnia , and civilian mobs have turned ceasefire lines into virtually impassable borders .

5949
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
The majority of refugees from Bosnia 's 1992-95 war are Moslems from the Serb-controlled north and east .

5950
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
NATO-led peace troops beefed up their presence in the Doboj area on Sunday to deter any sudden emotional attempt by the refugees to cross the Inter-Entity Boundary Line into Doboj .

5951
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
But the crowd dispersed without incident .

5952
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Moslems and Serbs have scuffled several times along the line in the past when Moslem refugees tried to surge into the town .

Eight killed in Moscow casino blaze .

MOSCOW 1996-08-25

5955
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Eight people died on Sunday in a blaze at a Moscow casino which the fire service said might have been started deliberately , Interfax news agency said .

5956
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
The number of casinos has soared in Moscow since the collapse of communism .

5957
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
The mayor has said he wants to cut their number to five as part of a war against organised crime .

5958
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree on fighting crime in July and handed wide-ranging powers to security chief Alexander Lebed , currently engaged in making peace in breakaway Chechnya .

5959
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Russian troops start pullout , but not in Grozny .

SHATOI , Russia 1996-08-25

5961
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Russian troops began to pull out from southern Chechnya on Sunday under a ceasefire agreement between Russian security chief Alexander Lebed and rebel leaders .

5962
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
But in the capital Grozny , the commander of Russian Interior Ministry forces in Chechnya , General Anatoly Shkirko , told Interfax news agency he was delaying a pullout of troops there after a group of Chechens disarmed an armoured column .

5963
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Reuters cameraman Liutauras Stremaitis said a column of around 40 vehicles , including tanks , armoured personnel carriers , artillery cannons and lorries , escorted by Chechen rebels , pulled out of the village of Shatoi towards the border , around 50 km ( 31 miles ) to the north .

5964
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
In Grozny , Shkirko told Interfax he was suspending the pullout of troops from the capital until weapons seized by the Chechens were returned .

5965
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Chechen rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov confirmed the weapons had been seized but that it was a maverick group of Chechens .

5966
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
He said later that the rebels had handed them over .

5967
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
The pullout of the Russian troops is a key element of the peace plan brokered by Lebed , which aims to end the 20-month Chechnya conflict .

5968
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Leftist Mexican armed group says troops in capital .

MEXICO CITY 1996-08-25

5970
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
The leftist Popular Revolutionary Army ( EPR ) in a published report on Sunday said it operated throughout Mexico , including the capital , and denied government assertions it was isolated to one state .

5971
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Commanders " Vicente " and " Oscar " , guarded by a dozen EPR gunmen , said in an interview with La Jornada outside Mexico City that the armed group was committed to overthrowing the government .

5972
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
" They ( government officials ) want to present us before public opinion as a local problem , as just being from Guerrero and as irrational radicals , " Commander Oscar told La Jornada .

5973
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
They said the ERP , whose fighters first appeared wearing military fatigues and brandishing assault rifles in the southwestern state of Guerrero on June 28 , had a 23,000-strong membership , but this could not be confirmed independently .

5974
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
La Jornada also reported on Sunday that the Mexican Army has discovered a 37-page , EPR manual detailing guerrilla tactics and strategies .

5975
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
It quoted the manual as saying : " The objective of the Basic Course on War is to provide for combatants of the EPR basic military knowledge for the armed conflict against the police and military apparatus of the bourgeoisie . "

5976
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
It was the second time armed " commanders " of the EPR have granted interviews outside Guerrero state , an extremely poor and volatile region where leftist protesters often have clashed violently with authorities .

5977
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Unlike the better known and unrelated Zapatista rebels in southeastern Chiapas state , the EPR has never taken on the army in direct combat , according to official reports .

5978
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
There have only been a few skirmishes in Guerrero in which a handful of police , soldiers and civilians have been killed or injured .

5979

BOGOTA , Colombia 1996-08-25

5981
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Unidentified gunmen dragged 10 men out ot their homes in a rural area of Colombia 's northwest province of Antioquia and shot them to death , authorities said on Sunday .

5982
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Police said the killings occurred on Saturday morning in the municipality of Anza but news of the massacre only reached the provincial capital of Medellin early on Sunday .

5983
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Anza is only 20 miles ( 30 km ) west of Medellin , but there are no roads linking it directly to the city .

5984
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Police initially said leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) rebels were prime suspects in the killings .

5985
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
But gunmen of the left and right have killed with impunity across Antioquia for years , and there were unconfirmed reports that the latest bloodshed was the work of a right-wing paramilitary group .

5993
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Two Thai border policemen were seriously wounded on Sunday when members of a Burmese rebel splinter faction ambushed their patrol in northwest Thailand , security officers said .

5994
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
The two were wounded in the early hours of Sunday when some 30 members of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army ( DKBA ) ambushed their patrol on the Thai side of the border with Burma , to the north of the town of Mae Sot .

5995
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
The Thai army commander in the area , Col Suvit Maenmuan , told reporters the DKBA , which is allied with the Rangoon military government and based in southeast Burma , had recently stepped up cross-border infiltration .

5996
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Suvit said the motive for their intrusions was not clear but he had ordered reinforcements to beef up security along the porous frontier .

5997
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
The DKBA was formed in late 1994 by hundreds of guerrillas who split from the anti-Rangoon Karen National Union ( KNU ) and allied themselves with Burmese government army , their former enemies .

5998
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
DKBA members have since launched intermittent cross-border attacks on Karen refugee camps in Thailand , where the majority of inhabitants are KNU supporters , and on Thai villages and police posts near the border .

5999
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Bangkok has complained to Rangoon about the raids but Burmese military authorities say they have no contol over the faction .

6000
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Thai army commanders reject the explanation , saying they have evidence the Burmese army supplies and directs the renegade ethnic minority splinter faction .

6004
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,000
" A U.S. F-14 military plane while landing at Ben Gurion airport blew a wheel and a fire broke out , " said spokesman Yehiel Amitai , adding that the two pilots on board were not injured .

6005
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
" Airport officials declared an emergency situation at the highest level and the fire brigade put out the flames while the plane was landing , " he said .

CAIRO 1996-08-25

6008
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Archaeologists in Egypt have found pots used by ancient Egyptians in burial rites that they say may reveal the secrets of mummification .

6009
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Mohammed Saleh , director of the Egyptian Museum , told Reuters television a U.S. team found the pots , some of which contain human intestines , in a tomb built into the rocks while digging in Dahshour , a village 40 km ( 25 miles ) south of Cairo .

6010
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Dahshour is the site of Egypt 's second largest pyramid , built for the pharaoh Seneferu more than 4,500 years ago .

6011
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Saleh said the team -- from New York 's Metropolitan Museum -- found four Canopic jars and two unguent jars in the tomb , which belongs to an unidentifed person who lived during the 12th Dynasty ( 1991-1786 BC ) in the Middle Kingdom .

6012
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
" This finding is important because one of the jars still contains substances and materials used in the conservation of mummies and the conservation of the intestines and all the things which were in the cavity of a person we have not identified yet , " Saleh said .

6013
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
" We hope that the analysis of such substances and liquids will reveal some secrets of the mummification process and materials used in this process , " he added .

6042
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Israeli President Ezer Weizman , weighing a possible meeting with Yasser Arafat , consulted on Sunday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , a spokesman said .

6043
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Weizman and Netanyahu met at the president 's official Jerusalem residence and planned to speak to the media at the end of their talks , the prime minister 's spokesman said .

6044
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Earlier , the director of the president 's office denied a report in Israel 's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that Weizman had already invited Arafat to his private home for talks in the coming week on the future of the Israel-PLO peace process .

6045
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
But the official , Aryeh Shumer , said it was only fitting that Weizman and Arafat should talk after the Palestinian leader sent the Israeli president a letter which Yedioth Ahronoth reported contained an emotional appeal to save the peace proces .

6046
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
The newspaper said Netanyahu , who is cool to meeting Arafat himself , opposed talks between Weizman and the Palestinian president .

6047
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
After Moslem suicide bombers killed 59 people in Israel in February and March , Weizman called for peace efforts with the PLO to be suspended .

6048
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Shumer said his current position was that the peace process must continue .

JERUSALEM 1996-08-25

6077
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Israeli President Ezer Weizman has invited Yasser Arafat to meet him at his private home , Israel 's biggest newspaper said on Sunday .

6078
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
The Yedioth Ahronoth daily reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who has said he has no desire to hold talks with the Palestinian president , opposes the meeting due to be held this coming week .

6079
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
The newspaper said Weizman scheduled the meeting at his private residence in the central Israeli village of Caesarea after Arafat sent him an emotional appeal " to save the peace process " .

6080
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Netanyahu met Weizman last Tuesday and voiced his opposition , Yedioth said .

6081
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
" I am prepared to postpone the meeting under one condition -- that you give me a commitment right now to meet Arafat yourself within 10 days , " the paper quoted Weizman as telling Netanyahu .

6082
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
It said Netanyahu had yet to give Weizman an answer .

6083
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
The office of Israeli president is largely ceremonial .

6084
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
But Weizman , a former defence minister and an architect of Israel 's peace treaty with Egypt , has spoken out frequently on the peace process with the Palestinians -- at times urging the former Labour government to slow it down .

NEW YORK 1996-08-23

6088
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Corporate America is planning major changes in employee compensation in the next few years , according to a recent study .

6089
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
What it comes down to is this : If you 're highly skilled , you 'll benefit nicely .

6090
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
But if you 're not and cannot contribute to your employer 's goals , you 'll be paid less .

6091
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
The survey , conducted in late 1995 and the early part of this year by management consulting firm Towers Perrin , showed that the focus will be on an employee 's overall value to the company 's bottom line -- rather than how well an employee performs a specific task .

6092
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Presently , for example , if an accountant 's job involves doing five specific tasks , he or she can expect a certain salary , said Sandra O'Neal , a Towers Perrin principal .

6093
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
In the future , the accountant will be evaluated solely on " knowledge , skill and abilities , " she said .

6094
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
In addition to using accounting skills , the accountant will also have to be creative , work well in a team , be sensitive to customer needs and set productivity goals .

6095
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
" The good news is , if you 're highly skilled and have many abilities , you 'll be paid more , " said O'Neal .

6096
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
" The bad news is , if you 're not skilled and ca n't contribute to a team , to customer service and the organisation 's goals , you 'll be paid less . "

6097
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Of the 750 mid-to-large size corporations surveyed , 81 percent had undergone a major restructuring in the last three years , and more than two-thirds reported that productivity and profits were up as result .

6098
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Next on the agenda for these firms is developing a new compensation structure , and 78 percent report that they are considering a new , skills-based plan for both management and non-management employees .

6099
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
This coming shift , O'Neal said , " is not just isolated or a fad .

6100
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
It 's an inexorable change . "

6101
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
After World War II , corporations adopted a " military model " creating hierarchical organisations where " the concept of defined tasks worked great , " she said .

6102
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
But as the economy became global , customers were more demanding and problems became more complex .

6103
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
" Multi-layers kept management at a distance from its customers , " O'Neal said .

6104
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Now organisations must change to stay competitive .

6105
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
O'Neal says firms will place a greater emphasis on teams and team performance in giving raises .

6106
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
If your team does well , you 'll do well .

6107
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
If it does n't do well , do n't expect a raise .

6108
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Is this fair to an employee who can go the distance but is on a team that ca n't keep up ?

6109
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
" That 's an important question we used to ask a lot , " said O'Neal . "

6110
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
It 's not a question we ask any more .

6111
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
The more important question is -- ' Do we have results ? '

6112
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
"

6113
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
To get those results , 27 percent of the companies surveyed plan to eliminate base pay increases in favour of cash bonuses and incentives , such as employee and team award programmes and education .

6114
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Companies that can change their culture and view employees as business partners will do well , O'Neal said .

6115
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
For example , the survey rated some participants in the survey as " high-performing " companies , based on their return on equity above 16 percent .

6116
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Those companies also said they already offer employees variable pay and business education , give their managers more control over pay decisions and celebrate employee and team success .

6117
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
" They respect employees more , they trust employees more and they value their employees more , " O'Neal said .

6118
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
" The key to success at high-performance companies is engaging employees in a business partnership .

6119
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
It will improve a company 's bottom line . "

01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Investigators arrested a senior police detective on Sunday in connection with their inquiries into Belgium 's child sex scandal , Public Prosecutor Michel Bourlet said .

6124
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
" Georges Zicot was arrested and will be charged with truck theft , insurance fraud and document forgery , " Bourlet told a news conference .

6125
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
He said there had been searches at three sites on Sunday , including one at the Charleroi judicial police headquarters where Zicot worked .

6126
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Zicot , 45 , is a specialist in tackling vehicle theft .

6127
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Belgian media reported that he had been questioned twice in the past two years about thefts but released both times .

6128
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
He was promoted to chief detective earlier this year .

6129
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Bourlet said two other people had also been arrested .

6130
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
One was Gerard Pignon , the owner of a warehouse where stolen vehicles were allegedly stored .

6131
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
The other was insurer Thierry Dehaan .

6132
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Bourlet said the investigation into the vehicle theft ring would be added to the inquiry into the paedophile sex scandal in which five other people have already been arrested .

6133
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
He said the connection was through Bernard Weinstein , an accomplice of convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux -- the central figure in the paedophile scandal that has sent shockwaves across Europe .

6134
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Weinstein was found dead last weekend alongside the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in a house belonging to Detroux , who said they starved to death earlier this year , nine months after being abducted in June 1995 .

6135
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Two other girls have been rescued and police are hunting for at least two more who Dutroux has admitted kidnapping a year ago .

6136
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,000
" Dutroux has admitted killing Weinstein after a disagreement between the accomplices in an affair of truck theft , " Bourlet said .

6137
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Another four people were also questioned at the weekend but had not been detained , Bourlet added .

6138
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Anne Thily , public prosecutor in the eastern city of Liege where Julie and Melissa lived , said this was a major case involving some 50 investigators -- including two from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation .

A bus fell from a mountain road into a river in Pakistan-ruled Azad ( free ) Kashmir on Sunday , killing at least 19 people and injuring 11 , police said .

6148
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
They said dead included five refugees from the Indian-ruled part of Kashmir , where Moslem militants have waged a separatist revolt since early 1990 .

6149
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
The police said 14 of the 45 passengers on the bus died instantly when the vehicle fell into Kunar river from a narrow road leading from the state capital Muzaffarabad to the nearby Pakistani town of Garhi Habibullah northwest .

6150

6153
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
The planned reopening of Afghanistan 's main northern Salang highway as a result of peace talks with an opposition alliance has been put off until Wednesday , official Kabul Radio said on Sunday .

6154
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
The embattled Afghan government said last week that the Kabul-Salang highway would be opened on Monday or Tuesday following talks with the Supreme Coordination Council alliance led by Jumbish-i-Milli movement of powerful opposition warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum .

6155
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
The radio said on Sunday the postponement of the opening had been made due to " precautions " .

6156
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
It did not elaborate .

6157
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
The Salang highway , Afghanistan 's main route to Central Asia , has been controlled by Dostum since he began fighting President Burhanuddin Rabbani 's government in Kabul in January 1994 in alliance with Hezb-i-Islami party leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , then prime minister but rival to the president .

6158
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Hekmatyar rejoined the government as prime minister last June under a peace pact with Rabbani and has since been trying to persuade other opposition factions to follow suit .

6159
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Earlier this month , Jumbish denied a Kabul government statement that the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire in the north .

6164
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
The strikers barricaded streets , attacked the local office of the ruling Awami League , fought running battles with police and set alight hundreds of copies of the popular " Janakantha " newspaper , alleging it was pro-government .

6165
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Police used batons and teargas to try to disperse students who were throwing stones and home-made bombs , witnesses said .

6166
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
The strike , called by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) , to denounce the deaths of four students killed by police over the last few days , coincided with a visit to the area by Hasina .

6167
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Local officials said one policeman was killed by gunshots during clashes with pro-opposition students on Thursday .

6168
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Hasina told a cross section of people at the Bogra police headquarters on Sunday that the government had already suspended three police officers and ordered a judicial probe into the violent incidents .

6169
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
The prime minister offered financial grants to the families of those killed , ordered the best possible medical care for the injured and urged Bogra residents to call off the strike .

6170
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Opposition legislators walked out of parliament in Dhaka on Sunday denouncing " unprecedented police barbarity " against opposition students and supporters .

6171
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
They renewed their call for the resignation of Home ( Interior ) Minister Rafiqul Islam .

6172
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Hundreds of police raided the Dhaka university on Sunday , arresting nearly 30 outsiders who had been living in student dormitories and seizing weapons , university officials said .

6173
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Police stormed ten residence halls on the campus , flushed out people at gunpoint and searched their baggage .

6174
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
They seized revolvers , sawn-off rifles , shotguns and knives .

6175
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
The students were later allowed to return .

6176
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
The swoop followed the resignation of the university 's Vice-Chancellor Dr. Emajuddin Ahmed on Saturday over the deteriorating law and order situation on the campus .

6177
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Authorities closed down the 28,000-student university on Wednedsay following gunbattles between students and police .

6178
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Police said they fought armed activists from the BNP , headed by former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia .

6179
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Hasina told police the home ministry had already given a " blanket order " to arrest terrorists and possessors of illegal firearms irrespective of their political identities .

6180
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Nearly 100 students have been injured in the clashes in Dhaka and Bogra , police told reporters .

6183
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
At least 16 people were killed and several injured on Sunday when a bus fell from a mountain road into a ravine on a river bank in Pakistan-ruled Azad ( free ) Kashmir , police said .

6184
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
They said 14 out of 45 passengers on the bus died instantly when the vehicle fell from the narrow road while on its way from the state capital Muzaffarabad to the nearby Pakistani town of Garhi Habibullah in the northwest .

6185
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Two died later in hospital .

BATKIVSHCHYNA COLLECTIVE FARM , Ukraine 1996-08-26

6189
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Four shiny new green-and-yellow John Deere combines parked at this 1,750-hectare ( 4,325-acre ) farm in the grain-growing regions south of Kiev do n't fill its chief agronomist with enthusiasm .

6190
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
" They did a good job this year , but they need good diesel and good engine oil , " said Ivan Odnosum . "

6191
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
God help us if there is a breakdown , " he said of the machinery , loaned to the farm after the Ukrainian government bought it earlier this year .

6192
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
The country 's grain harvest this year is forecast to fall by more than 23 percent to only 28 million tonnes and two harsh factors are to blame .

6193
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
A drought scoured the steppes in May and June , stunting the growing wheat .

6194
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
And the farming sector , making the painful transition from Soviet central planning to a market economy simply has no money .

6195
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Ukraine 's black soil is so fertile that a diplomat described it as " rich enough to grow rubber boots " .

6196
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
But recently Ukraine has been losing its reputation as a breadbasket of Europe , earned in the years before brutal forced collectivisation under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin .

6197
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
" The wheat will not be of a good quality this year , " said Hryhory Borsuk , a scientist at the Mironivka Wheat Institute , run by the Ukrainian Academy of Agrarian Sciences .

6198
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
" The temperature on the ground reached 62 decrees Celsius ( 143.60 Fahrenheit ) this summer .

6199
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
We 've never seen anything so bad , " he said in an interview in his office , unlit since the government cut off electricity because of unpaid power bills .

6200
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
The harvest is gathered in the dry areas , but rainfall in Western Ukraine has delayed harvesting there .

6201
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
While Mironivka 's scientists , some unpaid for months , carry on developing new strains of wheat resistant to Ukraine 's extreme continental climate , Borsuk said the lack of cash in Ukraine 's agricultural sector is as bad as the drought .

6202
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Collective farms and Ukraine 's nascent private farming sector have no money for fertiliser , no money for herbicides and pesticides , no money to repair old or buy new machinery , no money for fuel , and none to buy good seed .

6203
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
This year 's harvest is down from last year 's 36.5 million tonne harvest , which in turn compares with 50 million tonnes in 1990 , the year before independence .

6204
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
The decline is all the worse for people who recall wasteful Soviet times , when the Kremlin imported grain but priced bread so cheaply that people bought it to feed their pigs .

6205
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
" Agriculture is very expensive , and there are no solutions to our problems on the horizon , " said Odnosum .

6206
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
He said his farm , its 260 workers now readying the fields for winter wheat sowing , expected the land to yield 5.2 tonnes per hectare ( 2.5 acres ) but ended up with 3.9 tonnes -- still better than the national average of 2.11 tonnes per hectare this year .

6207
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
" We did not have money for fertiliser , we 're in debt for fuel , and we 're borrowing diesel , " Odnosum said .

6208
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
A few kilometres ( miles ) down the two-lane road which passes Odnosum 's farm , where the occasional horse-drawn buggy passes by , is the 1,700-hectare ( 4,200-acre ) Shevchenko collective farm , built next to a village still neat and tidy despite post-Soviet decay .

6209
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Chief Accountant Natalya Sypron said the collective is strapped for cash , earlier this year bartering 220 tonnes of grain for diesel to fuel six rickety grain combines and tractors badly in need of repairs and basic maintenance .

6210
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
The average family earns 160-200 million karbovanets a year ( $ 800 - $ 1,000 ) -- but many have not been paid in months , Soprun said . "

6211
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
People are working out of their own dedication . "

6212
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Borsuk said the farm sector has two options : " We can sit down and cry , or we can do something . "

6213
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,000
He said the government plans to increase the sowing of the winter wheat which will be harvested next year .

6214
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Planted in late summer and early autumn , the grain is Ukraine 's largest export item and traditionally grows better than summer wheat in Ukraine 's soil .

6215
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Further plans , he said , called for full provision of resources like fertiliser and herbicides for 25 percent of Ukraine 's arable land next year , for 50 percent in 1998 and 100 percent of the land in 1999 .

6216
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
" If we follow this we 'll be able to sell 10 million tonnes of grain by the year 2000 , " Borkus said .

6217
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
The government has been trying to phase out huge subsidies to the farm sector , and in a move back to pre-Soviet days has given up to 50 hectares ( 124 acres ) of land to some 36,000 private farmers willing to go it alone .

6218
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Collective farms will last for the next few years , because most private farms now only produce enough to feed themselves with maybe a little extra to sell , said one private farmer : " In the future , maybe , but it 's better not to hurry .

6219
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
" Collectivisation brought us a lot of pain .

6220
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
And it went too fast .

6221
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Privatising too quickly can also have a negative outcome . "

JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-26

6225
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Gencor Ltd on Monday said it had swelled its year attributable profit and streamlined operations to strengthen it for the current financial year despite a variety of divisional setbacks .

6226
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Announcing the group 's results for the year ended June 30 , chairman Brian Gilbertson said : " Happily the strong improvement in financial performance is not an illusion arising from the recent weakness of the rand relative to the dollar . "

6227
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Gencor raised attributable earnings to 1,803 million rand from 1,003 million rand previously - in dollar terms an increase to $ 469 million from $ 279 million - and won despite the group 's Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd posting dismal results .

6228
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
" Not everything has gone well .

6229
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
We 've had substantial production difficulties at a number of our operations .

6230
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
The most obvious one with the greatest effect on the corporation was at Impala where we had the furnace failure , " Gilbertson said .

6231
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Implats posted year attributable profit of 176 million rand from 281 million previously .

6232
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Not only did the company lock in 3.92 rand per dollar in February / March , but it suffered output losses due to a furnace shutdown last August .

6233
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
The rand was last bid at 4.5350 against the dollar .

6234
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Nor was Implats the only operation to fail output targets .

6235
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Ingwe Coal Corporation Ltd was hit hard by heavy rains .

6236
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
It forfeited nearly one million tonnes of production to flooding at its mines in Mpumulanga province .

6237
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
But Gilbertson said the greatest gloom in the year came from the European Commission 's blocking of Implats ' proposed merger with Lonrho Plc 's platinum interests .

6238
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
" The big disappointment for the year was the failure of the platinum merger .

6239
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
From Gencor 's perspective we are taking the position that it is not on , " Gilbertson said .

6240
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Looking ahead to the current financial year , he said that Gencor would boost earnings further .

6241
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
" Gencor is well placed to take up the challenges of the future .

6242
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
The group is soundly structured and prudently financed and is blessed with an excellent portfolio of world-class businesses .

6243
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
I think we can look forward to further growth " .

6244
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Citing the disposal of Gencor 's stake in industrial holdings group Malbak Ltd for one billion rand among other smaller disposals , Gilbertson said Gencor had pruned its portfolio to concentrate on core assets .

6245
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
" We 've tried to clean up our overall portfolio by disposing of non-core assets .

6246
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
The biggest of those was Malbak .

6247
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Overall a very substantial pruning ...

6248
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
leaving Gencor clearly structured along commodity lines , " Gilbertson said .

6249
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
He added that the group still had about 85 million rand after tax invested in various shares , which were market for disposal when required .

6250
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Referring to Gencor 's increased 41.5 percent stake in Ingwe , Gilbertson said the group would wait for coal shares to be cheaper before considering snapping up more .

6251
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
" I think we would have liked to have more of Ingwe but it 's the question of adding value .

6252
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
When we bought the shares we bought ...

6253
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
at quite a bit lower than the price is now ...

6254
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
maybe if we just wait another few years for the next downturn in coal . "

6255
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Finally , Gilbertson said a growing proportion of Gencor 's income was coming from offshore and unlisted investments .

6260
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
unit , for about $ 400 million in cash , creating one of the world 's largest makers of intravenous infusion therapy products .

6261
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Under the agreement , IVAC and Advanced Medical 's wholly owned subsidiary , IMED Corp. , will merge to form a new company that will develop and manufacture infusion pumps that regulate the amount of intravenous fluid being administered to a patient , as well as proprietary disposable products .

6262
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
The combined company will have estimated revenues of $ 353 million .

6263
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Advanced Medical , through IMED , is already one of the nation 's largest developers and manufacturers of intravenous infusion pumps and proprietary disposable products .

6264
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,000
It has sales in 38 foreign countries .

6265
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
San Diego-based IVAC is a major provider of infusion systems and related technologies to the health-care industry .

6266
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,000
It has manufacturing plants in San Diego ; Creedmoor , N.C. ; Hampshire , England ; and Tijuana , Mexico , and distributes its prodcuts in more than 120 countries .

6267
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Eli Lilly sold IVAC on Dec. 31 , 1994 to DLJ Merchant Banking Partners LP , River Medical Inc. and other investors .

6268
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Advanced Medical said it expects to take an unspecified one-time charge to pay for the merger .

6269
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,000
It did not say when the charge would be taken .

6270
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,000
" The addition of IVAC is expected to contribute to financial results in the full second quarter of 1997 , " the companies said .

6271
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
The merger will add to both companies ' historical leadership in infusion therapy and technology-based drug delivery devices , they said .

6272
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
In 1968 , IVAC introduced the world 's first infusion therapy monitoring device .

6273
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
A year later IVAC improved its system with the addition of an IV pump that regulated the flow of liquids through positive pressure .

6274
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
IMED introduced the world 's first volumetric infusion pump in 1974 .

6275
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
IMED had profits of $ 1.7 million , or 6 cents per fully diluted common share , on $ 53.9 million in revenues in the first half of 1996 .

6276
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Excluding the effect of a one-time restructuring charge of $ 17.4 million , IVAC had net income of $ 4.2 million on net sales of $ 112.8 million for the 1996 first half .

6277
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Advanced Medical reported profits of $ 8.4 million on sales of $ 29.2 million in the quarter ended June 30 .

6278
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
William J. Mercer , IVAC president and chief executive officer , will become the president and CEO of Advanced Medical .

6279
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
He led the transition of IVAC to a privately held company and was previously senior vice president at Mallinckrodt Group Inc .

6297
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
St Helens needed to win on Monday to take the title -- a defeat or draw would have allowed Wigan their eighth consecutive championship .

6298
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
They were also the toast of London Broncos , who managed to scrape into the top four ahead of Warrington and qualify for the end-of-season play-offs .

6318
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Tommi Makinen took a significant step towards becoming world rally champion with a brilliant victory in the 1000 Lakes Rally on Monday .

6319
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Mitsubishi driver Makinen stopped experienced fellow Finn Juha Kankkunen in his tracks on the final day of the 1,452-km rally , doubling his lead on the first two decisive stages .

6320
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,000
" This was the most difficult win - three days at 125 percent effort , " said Makinen , whose success completed his 1,000 Lakes hat-trick .

6321
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Kankkunen was runner-up in his Toyota as Finland 's Jarmo Kytolehto produced a remarkable drive to finish third in his Ford .

6322
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Swede Kenneth Eriksson kept Subaru in the hunt for the manufacturers ' title with fifth place in spite of a gearbox problem that nearly forced him off the road close to the end of the event .

6323
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Maakinen 's and Mitsubishi 's positions were strengthened by the late retirement of Spain 's Carlos Sainz when his Ford gearbox failed .

6324
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Makinen , with 95 points , now leads his nearest championship rival , Sainz , by 32 points .

LEEDS , England 1996-08-26

6330
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Winger Lee Sharpe hit a superb strike from the edge of the penalty area to give Leeds their first win of the season on Monday and leave hapless Wimbledon anchored at the bottom of the England premier league .

6331
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Sharpe repaid a huge slice of the 4.5 million pound ( $ 6.98 million ) fee Leeds handed Manchester United for his services with a top-draw second-half goal to hand Wimbledon their third successive defeat .

6332
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Ian Rush , the Welsh striker signed from Liverpool in the close season , set up the goal , feeding Sharpe as he galloped forward and the former England winger cut inside onto his unfavoured right foot to arc a shot into the right-hand corner of the net .

6333
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
The only goal of the match also brought some relief for under-fire Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson following the team 's poor start to the season .

6334
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Home fans frequently booed their own side until Sharpe turned the jeers to cheers .

JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-26

6573
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
The tiny islands of the Seychelles failed to make soccer history at the weekend when they bowed out of the preliminary rounds of the African Nations Cup .

6574
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Trailing fellow Indian Ocean islanders Mauritius 1-0 from the first leg , they were held to a 1-1 draw at home on Saturday despite playing against 10 men for most of the match .

6575
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
The 2-1 aggregate took Mauritius into the group phase of the qualifiers for the 1998 finals , and kept up the Seychelles ' record of never having won an official match in their 10 years of FIFA membership .

6576
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
The Seychelles must have thought they were on course for a historic breakthrough when Mauritian midfielder Andre Caboche was sent off for a crude tackle in the 19th minute .

6577
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,000
But the visitors responded to the setback immediately -- veteran striker Ashley Mocude scoring a minute later to give them a two-goal aggregate lead .

6578
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Although Danny Rose 's 50th-minute equaliser gave the Seychellois renewed hope they could not find the net again and were eliminated .

6579
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Mauritius now play in group seven of the qualifiers against Malawi , Mozambique and favourites Zambia .

6580
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Namibia , who drew 0-0 with Botswana in their first leg , won the second leg in Windhoek 6-0 to stretch their unbeaten run to eight matches and continue their remarkable progress on the African soccer stage .

6581
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
They now play in group five with Cameroon , Gabon and Kenya .

6582
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,000
German-based striker Bachirou Salou returned home to Togo to score the decisive only goal of their tie against Congo .

6583
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Salou , who plays for MSV Duisburg in the Bundesliga , scored in the 53rd minute of Sunday 's match in Lome for a 1-0 aggregate win which takes his side into group six , where they will meet Liberia , Tanzania and Zaire .

6584
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Ethiopia needed a penalty shoot-out in Addis Ababa to overcome Uganda after a 2-2 aggregate scoreline .

6585
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Both legs ended 1-1 before Ethiopia won the spot kick decider 4-2 .

6586
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Uganda 's elimination follows their humiliating 5-1 aggregate defeat by Angola in June 's World Cup qualifying preliminaries .

6587
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
The other preliminary round second leg match , between Mauritania and Benin in Nouakchott , was postponed until Friday .

6588
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Benin won the first leg 4-1 .

MOSCOW 1996-08-26

6636
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Russian double Olympic swimming champion Alexander Popov was in a serious condition on Monday after being stabbed on a Moscow street .

6637
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,000
A doctor said it was too early to say whether Popov , the only man to retain the Olympic 50 and 100 metres freestyle titles , would return to top-level sport .

6638
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
" His condition is serious , " said Rimma Maslova , deputy chief doctor of Hospital No 31 in the Russian capital . "

6639
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
But he is conscious and is talking and smiling . "

6640
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Maslova told Reuters she was not an expert in sports medicine , but said it was too early to judge Popov 's chances of returning to competitive swimming .

6641
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Popov , who won gold in the 50 and 100 metres freestyle at the recent Atlanta Olympics , was stabbed in the abdomen late on Saturday after an argument with a group of roadside watermelon sellers in south-west Moscow .

6642
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Maslova said the wound had affected a lung and a kidney .

6643
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Doctors operated on Popov , 24 , for three hours .

6644
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Popov told NTV television on Sunday he was in no danger and promised he would be back in the pool shortly . "

6645
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
There 's no need to worry .

6646
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,000
We 're going to be walking soon -- and swimming , " he insisted cheerfully from his bed in the intensive care unit .

6647
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Interfax news agency said police had detained one of the attackers .

6648
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
It said the row started when Popov and a group of his friends were returning from a party .

6649
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Vitaly Smirnov , president of the Russian National Olympic Committee , said President Boris Yeltsin had given the swimmer Russia 's top award for his Olympic performance . "

6650
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,000
I am not a doctor but I think he is doing all right , " said Smirnov .

6651
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Smirnov said the Olympic Committee might ask the government to take measures to protect the country 's best athletes , some of whom have already chosen to live abroad for fear of a surge in crime in post-Soviet Russia .

RIO DE JANEIRO 1996-08-26

6785
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Two key players left a Brazilian championship match early on Sunday because they had to catch a plane to Russia to play with the national team .

6786
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Sao Paulo midfielder Andre and Santos defender Narciso were both substituted during their teams ' game , taken to Sao Paulo airport and flown to Rio de Janeiro in a private jet chartered by the Brazilian Football Confederation ( CBF ) .

6787
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,000
At Rio , they joined up with the national team squad for the journey to Moscow , where Brazil will face Russia in a friendly international on Wednesday .

6788
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,000
The problem arose because the Sao Paulo-Santos clash was selected as the day 's televised live match , forcing it to be put back three hours from the usual kickoff time .

6789
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Santos suffered more from their loss as Narciso 's replacement Jean gave away a penalty from which Sao Paulo scored the decisive goal in a 2-1 win .

6790
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Sao Paulo lead the first stage of the championship on goal difference from surprise package Juventude , who beat Internacional 2-1 .

6791
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Corinthians , who played in a tournament in Spain last week , also faced a plane marathon as they attempted to keep up with a hectic fixture list .

6792
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
They were due to leave Spain Monday night , arrive in Sao Paulo on Tuesday morning , catch another plane to the southern city of Curitiba one hour later and then play away to Atletico Paranaense in the Brazilian championship the same evening .

6793
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Botafogo striker Tulio , who was overlooked by Zagalo for the tour which also features a game away to the Netherlands on Sunday , scored his third goal in three games as the defending champions beat Bahia 2-1 away .

6794
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Tulio , who has been top-scorer in the competition for the last two seasons , has been struggling against injury for most of this year .

NEW YORK 1996-08-26

6921
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
A message on television monitors all around the National Tennis Centre reads : " Due to hot weather please seek shade and drink plenty of fluids " -- sound advice until you check out the price of fluids .

6922
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Perhaps the advisory was cut off before concluding : " ...and bring plenty of money . "

6923
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
A small bottle of a garishly-coloured sports drink at the sun-drenched U.S. Open is going for $ 3.75 , while a litre of basic , life-sustaining water will set you back $ 4.00 -- for water ?

6924
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
" At the Olympics water was only a dollar , and that was the Olympics , " said one incredulous fan , noting that the Atlanta Games had been notorious for price gouging .

6925
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
U.S. Open officials managed to insult most of the male tennis players last week with their controversial handling of the seeding and draw .

6926
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
When the tournament began on Monday it was the fans ' turn to be offended .

6927
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,000
" That baked lasagna better be good for $ 8.50 , " said New Yorker Rebecca Weinstein , a U.S. Open regular who was eating a sandwich she had brought from home .

6928
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,000
A trio of hungry fans at the food court who had already forked over the lasagna money pronounced it good , but Carol Perry chimed in , " The water is ridiculous , they want four dollars for the water , you might as well get a glass of wine . "

6929
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Indeed , a nice glass of chardonnay or white zinfandel was going for $ 4.75 , while an imported beer was just a bit more than the water at $ 4.50 .

6930
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
What 's the message here ? "

6931
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Maybe they want us to be alcoholics , " Perry joked before lifting her glass of wine .

6932
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Fans will be shelling out $ 12.50 for a hamburger and a large french fries .

6933
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,000
And that little snack is guaranteed to make you thirsty .

6934
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Make that $ 16.50 .

6935
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Even a sandwich as pedestrian as a ham and swiss cheese is going for a whopping $ 8.00 .

6936
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Of course , it is served on a tuscan roll .

6937
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
It must be the cost of flying those rolls over from Tuscany every day that drives up the price of the sandwich .

6938

TENNIS - HUBER AND MALEEVA FALL , UP-AND-COMERS ADVANCE AT OPEN .

NEW YORK 1996-08-26

6941
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Martina Hingis led a youthful charge and Australian Open finalist Anke Huber and Magdalena Maleeva were fallen seeds on Monday in a hot , sunny opening to the U.S. Open tennis championships .

6942
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
The 15-year-old Hingis , seeded 16th , was honoured to play the first match of the season 's last Grand Slam on Stadium Court but happy to hurry off with a straight-sets victory over the 112th-ranked Angeles Montolio of Spain .

6943
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,000
" It was very hot and I did n't want to stay long on the court , " said a cheery Hingis , who had no worries in racing to a 6-1 6-0 victory against the overmatched Spaniard .

6944
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Hoping for a longer engagement on the cement at Flushing Meadows were the sixth-seeded Huber of Germany and 12th seed Maleeva of Bulgaria .

6945
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Huber , who lost to Monica Seles in the Australian Open final , fell victim to an unfortunate draw in bowing to dangerous floater Amanda Coetzer of South Africa .

6946
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Coetzer , ranked 17th , avenged her defeat to Huber in the Australian Open semifinals by winning 6-1 2-6 6-2 .

6947
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
" I looked at it as not a first round match , just a great challenge for me , " said Coetzer , 24 . "

6948
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
I was really concentrating on keeping my own momentum and my own rhythm .

6949
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
" She is tough to play in that way because she plays very up and down .

6950
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
She played one great game and than a few errors .

6951
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
The challenge was just for me to keep playing my own game . "

6952
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Huber , who reached the final a week ago at Manhattan Beach , could only mourn her luck of the draw .

6953
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,000
" I was n't happy when I saw the draw .

6954
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
She was the first non- seeded player , " said the 21-year-old German . "

6955
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,000
It 's always tough to play somebody like that in the first round in a Grand Slam .

6956
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
" I think I did n't play that bad today .

6957
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
It was maybe my best first round match in a Grand Slam I ever played . "

6958
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Monday brought the best out in U.S. Open rookie Aleksandra Olsza of Poland , ranked 110th .

6959
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,000
The 18-year-old Olsza , last year 's Wimbledon junior champion , celebrated her debut in the main draw of the Open by removing Maleeva 6-4 6-2 .

6960
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
The curtain-raising victories by Hingis and Olsza provided a ringing endorsement for the newest wave of women 's players coming up from the junior ranks .

6961
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,000
The Swiss teenager , a twice French Open junior champion and a Wimbledon juniors winner , had already proven her main stage mettle by reaching the quarters at this year 's Australian Open .

6962
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
" I hope I can get into the last 16 , " said Hingis , seeded to face third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the fourth round .

6963
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Hingis has been working hard on conditioning and has lost eight pounds ( 3.5 kilos ) in advance of the championships .

6964
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
" There will be tough matches but I hope I can get there , " she said . "

6965
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Then we 'll see if Arantxa will be there , too . "

6966
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
The fast-moving Olsza , 18 , was cool in her opening match .

6967
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
" I was n't scared when I heard that I was playing Maleeva , " said Olsza . "

6968
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,000
I know that if I want to play professional tennis I have to do my best to try to beat her and I ca n't be scared . "

6969
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Olsza is undaunted by the level of competition in the pros .

6970
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
" In terms of tennis , I think the junior players are really good now .

6971
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,000
In a few years , it could change a lot among the top players . "

6972
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Two big-serving women 's players made quick work of Japanese opponents .

6973
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands , the 13th seed , was a 6-1 6-4 winner over Japan 's Nana Miyaga , while Czech veteran Helena Sukova prevailed over Yone Kamio 6-2 6-3 .

6974
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Austrian Barbara Paulus , seeded 14th , also reached the second round with a 6-2 6-1 victory over Yi Jing-Qian of China .

6975
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
TENNIS - STICH GLAD HE STAYED AFTER OPEN VICTORY .

Richard Finn

6977
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
NEW YORK 1996-08-26

6978
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Michael Stich nearly pulled out of the U.S. Open in protest over the men 's seeding fiasco but the former Wimbledon champion was glad he stayed after sweating out a four-set win on Monday over qualifier Tommy Haas .

6979
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
" I still feel it 's embarrassing what happened and I was about to pull out yesterday and say , ' That 's it , ' " said Stich , one of a host of men who cried foul over seeding procedures that forced an unprecedented remaking of the men 's draw last week .

6980
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
" But there are so many reasons to play , especially spectators and the kids who come out here and want to enjoy watching tennis , that I decided to stay . "

6981
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,000
In a break from tradition , the Open did not seed in strict accordance with ATP rankings , instead taking into account other factors that raised objections of favourtism toward U.S. players .

6982
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
One prominent player that did not stay for the Open was French Open champion Yvegeny Kafelnikov , who after being dropped three spots from his ATP ranking to a seventh seeding , withdrew and returned home to Russia .

6983
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Kafelnikov had pulled out of last week 's tournament with a rib injury .

6984
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,000
At a news conference attended by approximately 50 players on Sunday , U.S. Davis Cup player Todd Martin expressed the players ' outrage at the seedings .

6985
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,000
" The way the U.S. Open has seeded here , tampering with the ranking system , has tarnished the image and reputation of this U.S. Open in the players ' mind , and we think that is damaging to our sport , " Martin said .

6986
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Stich said he felt the players ought to have organised an active protest .

6987
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,000
" I feel that we made it a little easy for the USTA .

6988
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,000
They did n't really get hurt as much as I think they should have , " said Stich . "

6989
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
I feel that we should have maybe just cancelled out the Monday , not show up today and start the tournament tomorrow . "

6990
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,000
But once the 27-year-old Stich got on the court , he focused his energies on trying to win the year 's last Grand Slam .

6991
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,000
He took a positive first step with his 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 win over compatriot Haas on a sun-baked Grandstand court .

6992
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Others advancing early on Monday included 11th-seeded American Malivai Washington , the Wimbledon runner-up , Sweden 's Magnus Gustafsson , and two-time former French Open champion Sergi Bruguera of Spain , who will be Stich 's next opponent .

6993
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,000
The suspicion , however , lingers in Stich 's mind that U.S. Open officials did tamper with the seeding process in order to benefit homegrown players .

6994
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
" I get the feeling that everything is done here for the American players and they forget about all the other players , " said Stich , who lost the 1994 Open final to Andre Agassi .

6995
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,000
It was Agassi who was at the centre of the controversy that engulfed the tournament since the original draw was completed on Wednesday .

6996
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,000
The flamboyant American star was bumped up two spots from his ATP ranking of eight to a seeding of six .

6997
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
" He ( Agassi ) should be seeded the way he is playing tennis right now , " said Stich about the unfairness of moving up Agassi , who made early exits from the French Open and Wimbledon .

6998
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Stich , not seeded here for the first time since 1990 , might have benefitted from some fiddling with the seedings himself after Kafelnikov withdrew .

6999
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Ranked 18th in the world , Stich might have been slipped into that spot ahead of Spain 's Felix Mantilla , who is 16th but had never been played in the Open and had been left out of the seedings originally .

7000
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,000
But Stich did n't want to play that game .

7001
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,000
" I think he deserves to be seeded as everybody else who is in the top 16 deserves to be seeded , " Stich said .

7002

Lamonts Apparel Inc , an operator of 42 family apparel stores in six northwestern states , said it has filed a reorganization plan in bankruptcy court in Seattle .

( Corrects to make clear a reorganization plan has been filed ) .

7259
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
The reorganization plan calls for all secured claims to be paid in full .

7260
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Unsecured claims , including those of company bondholders , will be satisfied by issuing new common stock and warrants .

7261
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Unsecured claims are estimated at about $ 90 million .

7262
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Lamonts said it plans to issue 9 million shares of new common stock .

7263
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Of that amount , 4.05 million and 5.67 million shares will be allocated to the company 's trade creditors .

7264
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Between 4.75 and 3.13 million shares will be allocated to bondholders and other unsecured non-trade creditors and 200,000 will be allocated to existing shareholders in exchange for all existing stock of the company .

7265
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Bondholders and other unsecured non-trade creditors will receive warrants four about 2.2 million shares when the company 's market capitalization reaches $ 20 million .

7266
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Bondholders , other unsecured non-trade creditors , and existing shareholders also will receive warrants entitling them to roughly 800,000 shares when the company 's market capitalization reaches $ 25 million .

7267
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,000

7271
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Police said the 111 passengers and six crew on board the ferry Trident Seven , owned by France 's Emeraud line , were rescued by a variety of private and commercial boats after fire broke out in the engine room soon after it left port .

02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Bosnia 's election organisers will decide on Tuesday whether or not to postpone municipal elections scheduled as part of nationwide balloting , an OSCE spokeswoman said on Monday .

7278
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Officials from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) are considering the postponement following allegations of serious irregularities in the registration of Serb refugees .

7279
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
International observers say the alleged irregularities could affect the outcome of voting for municipal assemblies .

7280
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,000
" Tomorrow ...

7281
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,000
the Provisional Election Commission will consider the possible postponement of municipal elections only ...

7282
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
the other elections will be held on September 14 , " OSCE spokeswoman Agota Kuperman told reporters in Sarajevo .

7283
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
" I think that it would be very difficult to select which municipal elections would have to be cancelled .

7284
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I think probably if the decision ( to cancell ) were to be taken it would probably be all municipal elections ..

7285
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
. "

7286
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Kuperman added that options other than postponement were also on the table , but she refused to specify what they were .

7287
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,000
The Dayton peace agreement gave the OSCE a mandate to organise Bosnian elections .

7288
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,000
The Provisional Election Commission is OSCE 's top rule-making body for the poll .

7289
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
More than 600,000 refugees have registered to vote in 55 countries around the world , representing about 20 per cent of Bosnia 's total electorate .

7290
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,000
They are due to begin voting on Wednesday , August 28 , just one day after the PEC is supposed to make its decision .

7291
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Balloting inside Bosnia is scheduled for September 14 , when citizens are slated to elect municipal and cantonal assemblies , separate Moslem-Croat and Serb parliaments , a national House of Representatives and a three-man Presidency .

7292
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,000
A Sarajevo daily newspaper , Dnevi Avaz , which is close to Bosnia 's Moslem nationalist SDA party , on Monday said the OSCE would postpone the municipal-level elections until the Spring of 1997 because of the refugee registration problems .

7293
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,000
SDA has a representative on the Provisional Election Commission .

7294
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,000
" I do n't know what the source of the Dnevi Avaz report is , but it is consistent with what I have heard from western diplomats and from inside the OSCE , " said an OSCE staff member in Sarajevo who asked not to be named .

7295
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,000
" The word is that Frowick has decided to postpone municipal elections but that he will wait for one more session of the PEC on Tuesday to take everyone 's temperature on the issue . "

7296
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Ambassador Robert Frowick , an American , heads the OSCE mission in Bosnia .

7297
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,000
OSCE and independent monitors allege that Serb authorities have systematically discouraged refugees from registering to cast a ballot in the places they lived before the war .

7298
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Instead , the refugees were said to have been directed by their authorities to vote from strategic towns which had Moslem majorities before the 43-month Bosnian war , but which are now underpopulated as a result of " ethnic cleansing " .

7299
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Diplomats explain the purpose of this electoral engineering is to secure Serb control over pivotal towns inside the 49 per cent of Bosnia known as the Serb republic , consolidating through the ballot box what was initially taken in war .

7300
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,000
The top U.N. refugee official in the Balkans highlighted the voter registration problem on Monday .

7301
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,000
" Results of the registration for September elections herald a dismal future for multi-ethnicity in Bosia-Hercegovina , " warned Soren Jessen-Petersen , Special Envoy for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Former Yugoslavia .

7302
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,000
" In the run-up to elections , nationalistic political leaders are playing the ethnic / sectarian card , drumming up support within their constituencies by playing on bitter memories or fear . "

7303
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000

MOSCOW 1996-08-26

7306
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Alexander Lebed may finally get to discuss his Chechen peace proposals with Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday after a lost weekend in the region when he was forced to abandon plans to sign a new political treaty with the separatist rebels .

7307
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
It could be a sobering experience for the Kremlin security chief who , just two months after being appointed by the president and two heady weeks after taking charge of the Chechen crisis , had promised to wrap up the 20-month war by the weekend .

7308
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Despite a mood of compromise in the region after some of the worst fighting of the war , Lebed may be just finding out that concluding a long-term settlement , somewhere between rebel demands for independence and Moscow 's insistence that Chechnya remain part of Russia , will be no easy matter .

7309
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000
A chain-smoking former paratroop general with a sharp line in deadpan putdowns and a soldier 's knack for making life sound simple , Lebed managed to arrange an ambitious ceasefire in the region last week , days after the Russian army threatened to bomb its way back into the rebel-held Chechen capital Grozny .

7310
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,000
He returned at the weekend , pledging to conclude a political settlement that would make this truce work where all others have failed .

7311
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,000
But then he apparently thought better of it .

7312
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Saying he needed to tidy up legal loose ends on the deal -- and also cover his back against unnamed pro-war schemers in Moscow -- he flew back to the capital empty-handed on Sunday .

7313
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
He met Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday and , according to the press service of Lebed 's Security Council , could meet Yeltsin on Tuesday .

7314
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,000
It was not clear if the start of Yeltsin 's holiday , announced later , would affect plans to talk .

7315
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Moscow 's as yet undisclosed proposals on Chechnya 's political future have , meanwhile , been sent back to do the rounds of various government departments .

7316
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
It is not known what caused the delay in the peace plan .

7317
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Speculation mounted last week that Lebed was operating out on a limb in Chechnya as Yeltsin , hardly seen since his reelection last month , kept out of sight and then gave an interview criticising his envoy just as he clinched a truce .

7318
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:58,000
But Chernomyrdin took pains at the weekend to insist Lebed was playing for a united team and that the proposals he took to rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov had been agreed by Yeltsin .

7319
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,000
If that were the case , it was unclear why Lebed suddenly found it necessary to have the deal verified in Moscow .

7320
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Lebed himself said he was concerned that powerful interests in Moscow , who have profited from the war and want it to go on , would seize on any inadequacy in the deal to remove him .

7321
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Maskhadov warned that Lebed risked the same fate as a former Russian army commander in the region who sought a compromise and was blown up last year by -- so the Chechens say -- Russian forces .

7322
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Maskhadov may also have made new demands on Lebed , forcing him to check back with the Kremlin on what he could offer .

7323
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,000
A rebel spokesman said the two military men had come close to agreement on a face-saving formula acceptable to both sides and involving a referendum on independence at some future date .

7324
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Chernomyrdin said voters should decide Chechnya 's future but stressed there was no question of the government letting the region quit the Russian Federation -- something Moscow fears could encourage separatist tendencies in other ethnic regions , particularly in the strategic North Caucasus .

7325
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Lebed may be be finding that closing that political gap between the two sides is more difficult than just ending a war .

He would continue working on various documents and might meet " one state offical or another " .

" One must give B. Yeltsin a chance to rest and recover his health after the elections , " Interfax quoted Yastrezhembsky as saying .

Thousands of workers of Serbia 's Zastava arms factory entered the second week of protests on Monday over unpaid wages and the lack of a programme to revive the plant 's production .

7339
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,000
" We are stubborn , have strength and time to persist until our demands are met , " said the factory 's trade union secretary Dragutin Stanojlovic .

7340
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:20,000
" We are united and we are waiting for the government to decide what to do with us . "

7341
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Trade unions demanded payment of June and July wages and last year 's holiday pay , and called on government to develop a revival programme for the plant .

7342
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,000
The former Yugoslav national army consumed 90 percent of Zastava 's pre-war output , but like the rest of Yugoslavia 's economy , the new army of Serbia and Montenegro is crippled by lack of funds .

7343
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,000
In Kragujevac where the plant is based , 9,000 to 10,000 people gathered in the central square to express their bitterness at what Stanojlovic called government indifference .

7344
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:24,000
The ruling Socialist Party last week accused Serbia 's opposition of stirring up social unrest and using workers ' already difficult social position for their own interests .

7345
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,000
" Late wages , no work and ( the lack of a ) production programme are the main reasons for their protests , " a senior member of the local Socialist Party branch told Reuters .

7346
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,000
" But there is a significant influence of opposition parties that are collecting points ahead of coming elections . "

The party official said the union 's figure on the number of protesters was exaggerated . "

7349

There were about 1,400 to 1,600 people at the protest today -- much less then last week .

02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Bulgarian air traffic controllers will go on strike on September 3 demanding higher pay , the chief of the Bulgarian association of air traffic controllers ( Bulatka ) said on Monday .

7366
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Stefan Raichev told a news conference the strike by more than half of the 1,380 traffic controllers and technicians would paralyse traffic which has increased by 10 percent since last year .

7367
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,000
More than 1,500 planes per day fly over Bulgaria , in a strategic location between Europe and the Middle and the Far East , Raichev said .

7368
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,000
The director general of the air traffic service Valentin Valkov said last Friday that a controllers ' strike would be illegal .

7369
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Valkov said he could not curb the summer charter flights of national carrier Balkan Airlines , which carries thousands of foreign tourists to the Bulgarian Black Sea resorts .

7370
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,000
But Raichev said it would be " discrimination " against the other airlines if only Balkan planes were guided in .

7371
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,000
" Under the law before launching the strike we have to sign an agreement with our employer for a minimal transport servicing of emergency flights , " Raichev said .

7372
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Raichev said a lock-out with military air controllers was impossible as they did not speak English .

7373
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,000
The controllers are demanding the monthly wage be increased to $ 1,000 per month from the current $ 230 , as well as the resignation of the air traffic service 's management .

7374
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000

Israeli security forces ransacked a Bedouin encampment in the West Bank on Monday to expel them from an area which Palestinians say had been earmarked for Jewish settlement expansion , residents said .

7574
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
They said soldiers stole a gold necklace and about $ 2,000 in Israeli currency from an elderly woman and her daughter-in-law while rummaging through their luggage before destroying family shacks and animal barns .

7575
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
" They rammed our shacks with jeeps and destroyed the shack over my baby , " said 25-year-old Amina Muhammad . "

He was saved only by a miracle . "

7577
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
A spokesman for Israel 's civil administration in the West Bank said the Bedouins were moved because they were encamped on an Israeli army firing zone .

7578
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,000
The spokesman Peter Lerner said he knew nothing about soldiers having stolen anything from the Palestinians .

7579
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Israeli security forces have been pursuing Bedouin Palestinians living in the desolate wilderness between East Jerusalem and the Dead Sea , where several Jewish settlements have been established .

7580
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,000

7630

The boy was last seen alive Sunday night when he joined his two younger brothers and father in a bedtime prayer .

U.S. Midwest hog market seen steady Tuesday - trade .

7652

CHICAGO 1996-08-26

7653
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Midwest direct cash hog prices Tuesday were seen steady following strong demand Monday that lifted prices as much as $ 1.50 per cwt in some areas , livestock dealers said .

7654
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:34,000
The demand was sparked by Saturday 's active slaughter , which left some packers short on supplies to get Monday operations started , they said .

7655
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Top prices in Iowa / southern Minnesota Tuesday were expected to range from mostly $ 59.50 to $ 60.00 , steady following a $ 0.50 - $ 1.50 jump Monday .

7656
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Illinois tops were seen matching Monday 's at $ 59.00 with tops in Indiana at $ 57.50 .

7657
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,000
However , USDA reported tops of $ 58.00 in Illinois and in Iowa / southern Minnesota , $ 60.00 on some hogs Monday .

7658
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Attempts to move prices higher again Tuesday could be offset by expected increased hog marketings this week , sources said .

7659
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Producers were expected to ship as many hogs as they can ahead of the Labor Day holiday weekend , they said .

7660
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Demand for hogs is expected to be light by the end of the week , as the industry prepares for Labor Day , Monday , September 1 when most U.S. packers will be closed .

CHICAGO 1996-08-26

7665
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,000
No more mild-mannered and meek Al Gore , the vice president and likely heir apparent to President Bill Clinton , emerged on Monday as the new Democratic attack dog leading a front-line assault on Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich .

7666
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,000
While Clinton takes a train trip to the Democratic Convention that will renominate him on Wednesday for a second term , Gore is the bright star in the convention city now .

7667
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Crowds anxiously wait for his appearances , thrusting out hands for him to grip as they scream " 12 more years " -- a wishful hope to eight years of Gore after a Clinton re-election .

7668
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Over a 15-hour span from Sunday evening to Monday morning , so many people jammed Gore events that the fire marshal stopped members of Congress , reporters and others from entering a pro-Israel rally and a meeting of the New York delegation .

7669
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,000
In his appearances , the often stiff and wooden Gore seemed transformed into a new energetic , gesturing " pol " as he ripped into Republican presidential nominee Dole and Gingrich , who has emerged as the favorite right-wing foil of Democrats .

7670
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Gore told a roaring labor rally of about 1,000 union workers that Dole and Gingrich were the virtual personifaction of evil , without even mentioning that former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is Dole 's running mate .

7671
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
" With equal measures of ignorance and audacity this two-headed monster of Dole and Gingrich has been launching an all out assault on decades of progress of behalf of working men and women , " Gore said to whoops of " 12 more years . "

7672
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
" They want to drive you out of politics and they ca n't , " he added . "

7673
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,000
They want to silence your voices in elections . "

7674
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
At a downtown hotel Monday , the 48-year-old Gore gave Wisconsin delegates a taste again of the new Gore .

7675
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
" I want you to ask this question .

7676
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:56,000
What would Wisconsin face if the same extremist coalition , the Gingrich / Dole Congress , also controlled the executive branch ? "

7677
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Gore said .

7678
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Noting the next presidential term will probably see two or three Supreme Court justice nominations , he warned , " Their extremist agenda would come out of the Gingrich Congress , into and through the Dole White House , down through the Supreme Court . "

7679
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,000
He painted a scene of horrors he saw if Republicans controlled the White House and the Congress they hold now . "

7680
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Our personal and religious liberties would be at risk .

7681
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Medicare would be at risk of withering on the vine .

7682
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Medicaid would be at risk of being taken away from poor children .

7683
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Education would be at risk .

7684
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
The environment would be at risk from the polluters that control that coalition , " he said .

7685
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,000
His new style mixed an assault on Republicans with what he sees as " productive opportunity , a vision for the future that lifts up working families , that builds Wisconsin stronger , that builds America stronger .

7686
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,000
With your help we can re-elect Bill Clinton . "

7687
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Dole 's tax cut plans were called " deja-voodoo economics .... It 's a warmed-over plan that failed and drove our economy into a ditch .

7688
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
We got burned once and we wo n't let that happen to our nation again . "

7689
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Gore ridiculed Dole 's defense of the tobacco industry , praised Clinton for " courage " in advancing regulations of it .

7690
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
To the delegates of Wisconsin , a leading dairy state , Gore had the right audience in poking fun at Dole 's comparison to addiction to tobacco to those who ca n't tolerate milk .

7691
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,000
" Some people say milk is bad for you , " Gore said as Wisconsin delegates held aloft a plastic inflated cow .

7692
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:12,000
He praised Clinton for vetoing the Republican Congress ' attempt to repeal parts of the Clean Air Act , and criticized Republicans for " slashing money to combat drugs in schools . "

7693
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
" The choice has never been starker , the stakes today have never been higher , " Gore said . "

7694
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,000
We 're not going to let them get away with that . "

7697
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:17,000
The highlights of the first day of the Democratic convention on Monday were expected to feature a mix of party leaders and people who have overcome adversity .

7698
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Among the latter were gun control advocate Sarah Brady and actor Christopher Reeve and the politicians included Rep .

7699

Richard Gephardt and Sen .

7700

7701
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Here are thumbnail profiles of the convention 's key Monday speakers .

7702
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Sarah Brady -- The nation 's toughest gun control law is named after Ronald Reagan 's press secretary James Brady but it was his wife who was the major force behind its passage .

7703
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,000
As head of Handgun Control Inc. , Sarah Brady , 54 , campaigned nonstop for tough gun control in the years following the shooting of her husband and then President Reagan in 1981 .

7704
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Her reward was the passage in 1993 of the " Brady Bill " which requires a mandatory five-day waiting period for purchase of handguns and also mandates background checks for would-be gun purchasers .

7705
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Reagan recovered fully from his wounds but Brady , who was close to death after being shot by John Hinckley Jr .

7706
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,000
, suffered serious brain damage .

7707
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Sarah was Brady 's second wife and they have a son , James Scott Brady Jr .

7708
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Before the assassination attempt , she had worked for Republican congressmen and for the Republican Party .

7709
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Christopher Reeve -- Reeve was best known for playing the comic book hero Superman in four movies but his greatest heroics came in real life .

7710
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Reeve , an accomplished rider who owned several horses , suffered multiple injuries including two shattered neck vertebrae when he was thrown from his horse at an equestrian event in Culpepper , Virginia , on May 27 , 1995 .

7711
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Almost entirely paralyzed , Reeve underwent extensive surgery to fuse the vertebrae to the base of the skull and prevent any further damage to his spine .

7712
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,000
That allowed him to be moved to a semi-upright position .

Reeve , 43 , was classically trained as an actor but became the prototypical handsome leading man .

7715
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,000
He performed in summer stock and soap operas before being plucked as an almost unknown to play the lead in " Superman " and three sequels .

02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Richard Gephardt -- Gephardt , House Democratic leader , is a politician with a " Mr Clean " reputation who sought the presidency eight years ago and is widely believed to still have ambitions for the job .

7717
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Gephardt , 55 , the son of a milkman from a working class district of St. Louis , is a consummate congressional insider , sufficiently skilled in compromise and the ways of the legislature to manage the often-unruly House Democrats .

7718
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,000
A former lawyer , he was in the front line of President Bill Clinton 's battle with the Republican-led Congress over the budget but has opposed the president 's decision to sign the Republican-written welfare reform bill .

7719
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,000
He advocated tough action against foreign countries to cut U.S. trade deficits but sometimes been out of step with the party 's liberal wing .

7720
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,000
He was an opponent of abortion until 1986 and voted for President Ronald Reagan 's big tax cut bill .

7721
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Gephardt , a red-haired square-jawed man , is a less than fiery orator .

7722
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,000
His 1988 bid for the Democratic nomination only took off after he recreated himself as a firebreathing reformer of the establishment , standing up for blue collar workers and farmers .

7723
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Tom Daschle -- Daschle , 48 , was largely unknown outside Washington and his state of South Dakota when he surprisingly beat more prominent rivals to become Senate Democratic leader after the party lost its majority to the Republicans in 1994 .

7724
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,000
A mild-mannered and youthful man who rose rapidly after entering the Senate in 1987 , he presented himself as a Midwest moderate , as a Democratic winner in a Republican state able to unite Senate factions .

7725
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Concern that he might be steamrollered by the vastly more experienced Republican leader Bob Dole was dispelled when he showed a tough edge , outmaneuvering Dole in a wrangle over scrapping a gas tax and raising the federal minimum wage .

7726
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:46,000
In his early Senate years he was seen as a " prairie populist " , working on legislation protecting farmers ' prices and also on compensating veterans sickened by Agent Orange defoliant spraying in the Vietnam War .

7727
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Daschle was a key player in President Bill Clinton 's failed attempt at sweeping healthcare changes but when he became minority leader he declared he would be no water-carrier for the White House .

7728
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
He has made clear he opposed Clinton 's signing of the Republican-initiated welfare reform bill .

7729
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,000
He has spent his adult life in politics , coming to Congress as an aide in 1972 after three years in the Air Force and then being elected to the House of Representatives himself in 1978 .

Margaret McCullough , 55 , was found dead in her home on Saturday with gunshot wounds to the head .

7734
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Police , who at first thought her son had been kidnapped , found him on Sunday with a friend in his mother 's car in Oklahoma and arrested him .

7735
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
A shotgun and a .357 handgun were found in the car .

7738
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:58,000
McCullough had adopted the boy , who was the grandson of her late husband , shortly after his birth but neighbours said they often had loud arguments .

ARA gas oil barges were quiet although one trader said he had seen offers at $ 1 a tonne over September IPE for prompt barrels , while Antwerp material was available for 0-50 cents over September .

7756
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
The IOC tender had " a bearish impact , but not a great impact , " one German player said .

Fuel oil markets were also listless .

CLEVELAND 1996-08-26

7776
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Brush Wellman Inc said Monday that 10 of 24 lawsuits involving chronic beryllium disease have been dismissed since July 1 .

7777
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,000
The leading U.S. beryllium producer said in a conference call it has traditionally been pro-active regarding the workplace disease , a lung ailment which can affects a small percent of people whose immune systems are susceptible .

7778
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Of the 14 remaining suits , 10 were filed by employees of industrial Brush Wellman customers and Brush Wellman liability in such suits is typically covered by insurance , Timothy Reid , vice president of corporate communications , said on the call .

7779
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:39,000
The company was responding to an article in Sunday 's New York Times .

7780
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:40,000
He said the article largely reiterated information about the suits and the disease which had previously been made public via Securities and Exchange Commission filings and annual reports .

7781
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,000
" Brush Wellman has been a leader in dealing with health and safety issues ( related to chronic Beryllium disease ) for nearly 50 years , " he said . "

7782
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,000

CHILLICOTHE , Ohio 1996-08-25

7854
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,000
- Chelsea Clinton , until now carefully shielded from the exposure of public life , made her political debut on Sunday on her father 's whistlestop train trip .

7855
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Chelsea , 16 , was at President Bill Clinton 's side as he rode the rails through parts of West Virginia , Kentucky and Ohio , and was introduced at every stop .

7856
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:56,000
She even worked ropelines , shaking hands with excited fans .

7857
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Hillary Rodham Clinton saw her husband and daughter off on the trip in Huntington , West Virginia and then went on to Chicago to begin a rigorous Democratic Convention schedule .

7858
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Asked if Chelsea would have a prominent role in the campaign , White House spokesman Mike McCurry said : " She 'll do what she did today when she can .

7859
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,000
She has to go back to school . "

7860
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:00,000
The president 's daughter is going into her senior year of high school at Sidwell Friends School , a private school in Washington .

7861
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,000
McCurry said Chelsea has asked to go on the train trip and attend the convention where her father will be renominated , but said her exposure did not signal the start of a new political career .

7862
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Chelsea " is a very poised young lady , but she 's not that much interested in politics , " the spokesman said .

AMSTERDAM 1996-08-26

7865
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Dutch shares drifted to a lower close on Monday , dragged down by weakness in the domestic bond market and turnover depressed by the UK bank holiday and lack of any significant U.S. economic data .

7866
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,000
The AEX index of leading shares closed 4.54 points easier at 556.19 , the day 's low .

7867
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,000
The Dutch market had been on the defensive all day but a softer start to Wall Street did little to boost sentiment in late trade , dealers said .

7868
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,000
" It was always going to be a tough day with participation so low .

7869
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,000
But the only thing really worrying the market was the bonds , and that dragged us lower , " one dealer said .

7870
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Stocks were down across the board , with Dutch PTT topping the volume list and closing down 1.90 guilders at 58.70 .

7871
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,000
The post and telecoms firm posted an 8.5 percent rise in first half earnings on Friday , just below analysts ' expectations .

7872
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,000
IHC Caland reported first half results well under forecasts on Monday and the shares suffered as a result .

7873
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,000
They were trading unchanged just before the release of figures but closed 2.40 guilders down at 80.70 after it reported net profits of 34.9 million guilders against 36.6 million last year and estimates ranging from 37.5 to 47.2 million .

7874
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,000
IHC also forecast post tax earnings rising 21 percent for the full year .

7875
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Banking group ING traded ex-dividend today and finished 0.60 guilders weaker at 52.90 as a result .

7876
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,000
But Nutricia shrugged off its ex-div tag to soar a further 4.10 guilders to 214.40 continuing its explosive rally sparked by the 51 percent jump in first half net profits last week , which set the market alight on Friday , sending the shares up 18.40 at 210.00 by the close .

7877
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Engineering concern Stork started the day well as the shares attracted some follow-through interest to the announcement late on Friday that its Fokker Aviation unit had won a major order .

7878
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,000
But the rally was short-lived and Stork ended just 0.20 up at 51.00 guilders .

Tapie to quit French assembly seat as film opens .

PARIS 1996-08-26

7882
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Former businessman and soccer boss Bernard Tapie said that he would give up his seat in the National Assembly by Wednesday , the day a film by Claude Lelouche in which he stars opens in France .

7883
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,000
" I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens , " he said in a broadcast interview .

7884
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:24,000
" Just about , " he told Europe 1 radio when asked whether he had sent his letter of resignation to Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin .

7885
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,000
A Seguin spokeswoman confirmed that no letter or call had yet been received .

7886
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Tapie , 53 , was resigning just ahead of expected government action to eject him from the Assembly following a finding by the Supreme Court that he was bankrupt and thus ineligible for public office for a five-year period .

7887
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Tapie , the target of a blizzard of legal actions over his now-destroyed business empire and the Marseille soccer team he once ran , has a starring role in Lelouche 's " Homme , femmes : mode d'emploi " ( Men , women : instructions for use ) .

7888
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:28,000
He plays a power-hungry lawyer in the movie described as " a tender and cruel comedy " by Lelouche , who is making his 35th film .

7889
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:29,000
" I have paid too dearly for mixing two careers , " Tapie said . "

7890
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:30,000
In France , you cannot be a film artist and a national politician at the same time .

7891
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,000
That is why I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens . "

7892
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Justice Minister Jacques Toubon began last month the formal process of ejecting Tapie from the French parliament as well as stripping him of his seat in the European parliament .

7893
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,000
The French procedure was expected to be completed before October 2 , when the National Assembly is to reconvene after a summer break , but the European procedure was expected to take longer .

7894
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Tapie 's lawyer has said he intends to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in an effort to prevent or delay the loss of his European seat .

7895
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:35,000
But such an appeal , even if the court were to accept the case , which it is not obliged to do , would not suspend enforcement of the French judgement against him .

7896
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Tapie faces a probable spell in prison after he loses his parliamentary immunity , since two appeal courts have confirmed jail sentences of eight and six months against him for tax fraud and rigging a soccer match .

7897
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,000
He is appealing in both cases to the Supreme Court .

The Bank of France drained 3.9 billion francs at a securities repurchase tender held on Monday to allocate funds for injection into the money market on Tuesday .

7901
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
It accepted bids for 44.3 billion francs in new liquidity , 3.9 billion less than the 48.2 billion leaving the market on Tuesday when a previous pact expires .

7902
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,000
The new pact expires on September 3 .

7903
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,000
The Bank of France said it allocated 13.4 billion francs to bidders offering Treasury bills as collateral , satisfying 3.4 percent of such demand .

7904
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:44,000
It allotted a further 30.9 billion to bidders putting up private paper , satisfying 12.5 percent of this demand .

AMSTERDAM 1996-08-26

7908
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Dutch co-operative bank Rabobank Nederland BA 's net profit growth might slow to less than than 10 year percent in the second half of 1996 , executive board chairman Herman Wijffels said on Monday .

7909
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,000
The unlisted bank earlier announced a 1996 interim net profit of 853 million guilders , up 21.5 percent on the 702 million guilders reported in the first half of 1995 .

7910
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:50,000
He said second-half profit growth would depend on customer demand for loans , which was already easing , and the performance of financial markets , which were strong in the first half and boosted securities , trading and underwriting income .

7911
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,000
" We expect reasonable growth in the second half .

7912
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Maybe it will be in single-digits , " Wijffels told Reuters .

7913
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,000
He said growth in customer demand in the first half was 50 percent above normal but it was hard to maintain this pace .

7914
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Rabobank 's net profit was 1.43 billion guilders in 1995 .

7915
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:55,000
The bank earlier warned that profit growth would slow in the second half , citing the increasing momentum in profit growth in the comparative period of 1995 and increased investment .

7916
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,000
But Wijffels was unable to quantify second half investment to improve and extend domestic and offshore services .

The president of parliament had earlier said September 11 could be set for the debate .

7942

02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,000
The spokesman said Ekeus , chairman of the United Nations Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) , would spend two or three days in Iraq but declined to give further details .

7988
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
U.N. oficials have said Ekeus would hold talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz and other officials as part of an agreement Iraq reached with the United Nations in June to hold higher level political talks with Ekeus .

8034
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:54,000
European bourses closed mixed on Tuesday with London clawing back most of the day 's losses despite an unsteady start on wall Street , hit by inflation worries .

8035
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,000
The dollar weakened during the day with many dealers sidelined because of uncertainty over Tokyo 's monetary direction ahead of the important Japanese Tankan economic survey out on Wednesday .

8036
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:56,000
But it recovered at the close of trade .

8037
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Stocks in London started the week badly after a three-day weekend , slipping 0.3 percent , but bargain-hunters later moved in and the FTSE index recovered most of the lost ground to end only just in negative ground .

8038
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Tuesday 's patchy showing in London followed a string of records last week , culminating in Friday 's trading high of 3,911 , fuelled by a wave of European interest rate cuts .

8039
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,000
The London bourse drew little help from the unsettled morning on Wall Street , which slipped in and out of positive ground after a stronger-than-expected August consumer confidence report refuelled inflation fears , pulling U.S. Treasuries back from their early peaks .

8040
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Shortly after the report appeared showing the confidence index rising to 109.4 in August from a revised 107.0 in July , Wall Street relinquished virtually all its morning gains .

8041
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,000
" Treasuries remain very sensitive to any indication of a strong economy and we 're still in that summer doldrum period of light trading , " said Alan Ackerman , market strategist at Fahnestock & Co . "

8042
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Consequently , stocks and bonds are both subject to rapid swings . "

8043
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Frankfurt was the one bright spot in Europe .

8044
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Floor trading ended up 0.25 percent and the computerised IBIS index climbed nearly 0.4 percent , given a push by the performance of chemical shares . "

8045
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,000
The market is trading 100 percent on fundamentals at the moment as interest rate fantasy disappears -- it 's all company news , " said one trader .

8046
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,000
French shares ended slightly down amid growing unease about a difficult autumn for the government which also weighed on the franc , dealers said .

8047
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Bond prices were weaker and the franc was quoted at 3.4210 per mark for the first time since August 13 as worries about the government 's autumn budget and a weak U.S. currency lifted the mark and squeezed French investments .

8048
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:08,000
The dollar , which dropped sharply on Monday because of jitters over the Japanese Tankan survey , weakened further in quiet trading but regained losses to end the day close to Monday 's levels .

8049
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,000
" Besides the Tankan , there 's nothing really until the U.S. jobs numbers next week , " said a UK bank corporate dealer . "

8050
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,000
There is still the summer malaise hanging over the market . "

8051
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Foreign exchange markets regard the Tankan report as an important indication of the country 's future monetary policy direction .

8052
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,000
If it points to weakness in the economy , the report will help the dollar regain some lost ground as speculation of a near-term rise in Japanese interest rates will evaporate .

8053
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,000
The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent .

8054
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
The dollar was also pressured by the mark 's strength against European currencies amid renewed concerns over Europe 's economic and monetary union ( EMU ) timetable .

8066

Armed hijackers believed to be Iraqis released between 60 and 70 people on Tuesday from a Sudan Airways plane carrying 199 passengers and crew that landed in London after being diverted on a flight from Khartoum to Amman , authorities said .

8067
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,000
A spokesman for Stansted airport said that the unidentified hijackers were demanding to see a British-based member of the Iraqi Community Association , called Mr Sadiki , and that police were trying to trace him .

8068
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Police spokeswoman Kim White said police had already contacted Sadiki and were trying to arrange to bring him to Stansted , 30 miles ( 48 km ) north-east of London , to talk to the hijackers .

8069
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
The airport spokesman said the six hijackers , who police said were armed with grenades and possibly other explosives , were believed to be Iraqi nationals .

8070
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:30,000
The hijackers started to release people for the Airbus plane in batches of 10 , starting with women and children , in what police described as a " controlled release " .

8071
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Police said most of the passengers were Sudanese but that there were also an unknown number of Iraqis , Jordanians , Palestinians , Syrians and Saudis .

LONDON 1996-08-27

8076
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Ecological warfare has broken out across the British construction industry , striking some of the biggest corporates as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts -- their profit margins .

8077
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Described by one British company as " eco-terrorism " , it is seen as the new business risk of the 1990s .

8078
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Famous names like Tarmac Plc , Costain Group Plc and ARC , a unit of conglomerate Hanson Plc , have all been targeted .

8079
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Activist groups are no longer seen by British firms as a harmless , badly organised ragbag of students and hippies .

8080
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,000
" You only have to see them in action at protests , " said David Harding , spokesman at ARC , Hanson 's aggregates company . "

8081
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,000
They walk around with mobile phones and camera equipment , they communicate and gather support for demos via the Internet -- we 're talking about a highly sophisticated organisation . "

8082
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:42,000
One road protestor under the codename Steady Eddie told construction journal " Building " earlier this year , " If it comes down to full-scale economic warfare , we will aim to drive them out of business . "

8083
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,000
As well as financial threats , companies also emphasise the " terror " tactics used .

8084
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Costain 's contract to build the controversial Newbury bypass , which runs through a conservation area , has led to violent protests delaying building , bomb threats , staff intimidation and picketing of chief executive Alan Lovell 's home .

8085
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,000
A Costain spokesman told Reuters : " We 've had all sorts of protests at the head office and the chief executive 's house .

8086
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,000
But it 's when it gets to the ( employee ) families -- that it goes across the line . "

8087
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Tactics used by some underground groups including the cryptic Berkshire Wood Elves , which distribute leaflets with instructions on home-made explosives , are now the subject of a police investigation .

8088
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Other larger activist groups include Earth First , The Land is Ours , Alarm UK and Road Alert .

8089
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
The groups have targeted specific projects like the Newbury bypass and the M3 motorway through Twyford Down in the southern county of Hampshire .

8090
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,000
But they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road building programme and out-of-town superstores which they say create more traffic , pollution and damage local communities .

8091
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,000
The government has slashed its road-building spending .

8092
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Although protests may have contributed to the decision it has been seen primarily as economic rather than ecological .

8093
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Graham Watts , chief executive of the Construction Industry Council , said : " I do n't think many firms involved in tendering for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project .

8094
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:54,000
" But they are more alert than they were 3-4 years ago .

8095
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,000
There 's no doubt it 's a big issue now . "

8096
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,000
He says the damage comes in two forms : " Tangible -- in the form of extra costs , additional security , threats to staff and the more intangible damage caused by negative publicity . "

8097
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Watts said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract .

8098
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,000
" I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss . "

8099
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,000
ARC says it 's not just contractors in the front line but also suppliers like itself .

8100
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Its own quarries came under attack after it emerged that it may be a supplier for the Newbury bypass .

8101
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,000
" It was called the " First Battle of the Newbury bypass ' , " said ARC 's Harding .

8102
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:02,000
" We had 300 Earth First protestors invade and occupy our site .

8103
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Hundreds of thousands of pounds ( dollars ) of damage was done in one day .

8104
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Plus there was the knock-on cost of lost production and extra security in future . "

8105
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Simon Brown , analyst at investement bank UBS , said this new phenomenon has led to a change in the way the industry evaluates project risk .

8106
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:06,000
" When talking to Tarmac about the M3 link ( through Twyford Down ) they made it fairly clear that their risk assessment methods have been changed and now involve a very clear environmental risk analysis . "

8107
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:07,000
Harding says others have done the same . "

8108
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:08,000
As a result of eco-terrorism we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security . "

8109
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:09,000
For an industry already suffering from razor-thin margins , overcapacity and stagnant demand , eco-terrorism is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector 's tale of woe .

LONDON 1996-08-26

8112
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:12,000
London 's annual Notting Hill Carnival , the largest in Europe and second in the world only to Rio , ended peacefully on Monday with an estimated 800,000 revellers singing and dancing the day away in high spirits .

8113
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Police said they made 30 arrests and there were two stabbings .

8114
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,000
But there was no repeat of the ugly scenes that used to scar the street festival , and police praised the crowds over the two days of festivities as good-natured .

8115
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Around 400 police were wounded in riots in 1976 when the carnival , now in its 31st year , acquired its darker reputation from which it is now only slowly recovering .

8116
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Shopkeepers still board up their windows and many residents leave town for the weekend , but for four or five years there has been no disorder and relatively little crime .

Indonesia newspaper reports central bank scandal .

8127
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,000
JAKARTA 1996-08-27

8128
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Indonesia 's central bank suffered seven billion rupiah ( $ 2.9 million ) in losses resulting from fake transactions , the Jakarta Post reported on Tuesday .

8129
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,000
A Bank Indonesia spokeswoman confirmed the newspaper report but declined to give further details .

8130
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,000
The bank 's governor Sudradjat Djiwandono was quoted as saying on Monday about 5.4 billion rupiah of the seven billion rupiah had been recovered .

8131
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,000
The newspaper said it was the central bank 's first public scandal in its 43-year history .

8132
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:32,000
The paper said five people had been arrested and police were looking for two more suspects .

8133
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,000
( $ 1 = 2,341 rupiah )

8134

GOLF - PLAYERS DIVIDED ON CART REQUEST FOR OLAZABAL .

8135
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,000
NORTHAMPTON , England 1996-08-27

8136
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Seve Ballesteros and Colin Montgomerie are divided on whether Jose Maria Olazabal should be allowed to return to the European PGA Tour using a motorised cart to transport him around the course .

8137
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,000
The Spaniard has not played for nearly a year because of rheumatoid arthritis in both his feet , and organisers of a pairs event to be staged in Bordeaux , France from October 17 to 20 have been asked to provide him with a buggy .

8138
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,000
" If the ( Tour 's tournament ) committee decides to change the rule I would not be against it , " said Ballesteros , Olazabal 's compatriot and Ryder Cup captain .

8139
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:39,000
But commitee member Montgomerie said it could set an unhelpful precedent . "

8140
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:40,000
I know Olly 's situation is very unfortunate , but I do n't think we can start giving dispensations , " he said . "

8141
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,000
You 've got to have a rule for everybody and I do n't think it 's feasible . "

8142
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,000
The use of carts is generally prohibited in the professional game , and if Olazabal is allowed to use one in Bordeaux , he might then request one for the qualifying tournaments for next year 's Ryder Cup .

LONDON 1996-08-27

8364
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Graham Gooch , the 43-year-old former England captain , is to continue playing county cricket for at least another season , his club Essex announced on Tuesday .

8365
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Opener Gooch 's decision comes towards the end of a season in which he has underlined his consistency by becoming the leading scorer in Essex 's history , beating Keith Fletcher 's aggregate of 29,434 .

8366
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Gooch , who retired from test cricket after the 1994-95 tour of Australia but is now an England selector , is seventh in this season 's first-class averages with 1,429 runs at 64.95 , having hit five centuries and one double century .

8367
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Essex secretary-general manager Peter Edwards said : " He is a remarkable batsman and still the best in this country .

8368
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,000
No-one will argue with that .

8369
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:29,000
You just have to look at his record to appreciate that fact . "

SOCCER - ROMANIA CLUB BOSS BANNED FOR HEADBUTT .

8371
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:31,000
BUCHAREST 1996-08-27

8372
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:32,000
The Romanian Soccer Federation has banned first division club Jiul Petrosani 's president Miron Cozma for two years for headbutting a visiting team player , a federation statement said .

8373
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Romania 's soccer bosses also fined Cozma , a well-known miners ' union leader , 10 million lei ( $ 3000 ) for the half-time attack on Dinamo Bucharest 's Danut Lupu last Sunday .

8374
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Miners led by Cozma rioted in Bucharest in 1990 and 1991 , bringing down the reformist government of premier Petre Roman .

8375
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Cozma is awaiting trial for assault and criminal damage in a bar in his home town of Petrosan , 300 kms west of Bucharest .

8376
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,000
The attack on Lupu came during a tunnel skirmish between opposing players as they left the field .

8377
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,000
" Cozma 's blow was not too painful because I 'm a tall man , " Lupu told Reuters on Tuesday .

8378
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Lupu is one of the tallest players in Romania 's first division , towering over Cozma by some 17 cms ,

8379
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Jiul Petrosani , promoted to the first division this year , won the league game 1-0 .

8380
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Cozma is barred from taking part in any official soccer activity during the ban .

NEW YORK 1996-08-27

8404
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Stefan Edberg produced some of his vintage best on Tuesday to extend his grand run at the Grand Slams by toppling Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek in straight sets at the U.S. Open .

8405
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Edberg , competing in the 54th consecutive and final Grand Slam event of his illustrious career , turned back the clock at Stadium Court with a flowing 6-3 6-3 6-3 serve-and-volley victory over the fifth-seeded Dutchman .

8406
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:06,000
" It 's a win that I can be proud of , " said the 30-year-old Swede , winner of two U.S. Opens and six Grand Slam titles in all . "

8407
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
It 's never easy to beat the Wimbledon champion . "

8408
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Edberg , who has said he will retire at season 's end , made it look easy under gray skies at the National Tennis Centre .

8409
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,000
The unseeded Swede struck quickly , breaking Krajicek in the first game and never let loose his grip on the one hour 44 minute match as he served and volleyed with the grace that made him one of the dominant players of his time .

8410
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:10,000
" There 's not doubt about it , Richard was definitely off his game and I took advantage , " said Edberg .

8411
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:11,000
" I still have my days where I feel great out there . "

8571
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:51,000
VanLandingham ( 8-13 ) , who entered the game with one complete game in the first 56 starts of his career , limited the Phillies to two hits and two walks with four strikeouts .

8572
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
" We 've been working all year on my follow-through , and I really concentrated on that , " VanLandingham said . "

8573
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,000
It gave me more life in all of my pitches , so the ball moved more . "

8574
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
At Colorado , Andres Galarraga homered and drove in three runs as the Colorado Rockies had 10 extra-base hits and Billy Swift won his first game in almost a year in a 9-5 rain-shortened seven-inning victory over the Cincinnati Reds .

8575
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Swift ( 1-0 ) , who made his first start since June 3rd and underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder earlier in the season , allowed five runs and six hits in five innings .

8576
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:56,000

BALTIMORE 1996-08-27

8581
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Cal Ripken 's bases-loaded walk scored Brady Anderson with the winning run in the bottom of the 10th as the Baltimore Orioles regained control of the top spot in the wild-card race with a wild 12-11 victory over the Oakland Athletics .

8582
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Trailing by a run entering the 11th , the Orioles rallied against Oakland reliever Mark Acre ( 0-2 ) with a walk and a triple by Brady Anderson to tie the game .

8583
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Then Oakland manager Art Howe decided to intentionally walk Rafael Palmeiro and Bobby Bonilla to load the bases but Acre was nowhere near the plate to Ripken .

8584
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:04,000
The decisive pitch nearly hit Ripken and gave the Orioles a one-half game lead over the Chicago White Sox in the wild-card race .

8585
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:05,000
In Seattle , Jay Buhner 's eighth-inning single snapped a tie as the Seattle Mariners edged the New York Yankees 2-1 in the opener of a three-game series .

02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:06,000
New York starter Jimmy Key left the game in the first inning after Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez lined a shot off his left elbow .

8587
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,000
The Yankees have lost 12 of their last 19 games and their lead in the AL East over Baltimore fell to five games .

8589
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Boston has won seven of eight and is 20-6 since August 2nd .

8590
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,000
The Red Sox are two games over .500 for the first time this season .

8591
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:11,000
In Chicago , Cal Eldred pitched 5-1/3 scoreless innings and John Jaha scored one run and doubled in another as the Milwaukee Brewers held off the slumping Chicago White Sox , 3-2 .

8592
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Eldred ( 6-5 ) walked one and struck out three .

NEW YORK 1996-08-26

8616
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Michael Chang is playing in his 10th U.S. Open and enjoying his highest seeding ever , but the 24-year-old American had to overcome a case of the jitters Monday before winning his first-round match on opening day .

8617
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Chang , seeded second behind defending champion Pete Sampras , took two hours 40 minutes to defeat 186th-ranked Jaime Oncins of Brazil 3-6 6-1 6-0 7-6 , 8-6 in the tiebreaker .

8618
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,000
" I was pretty tight the whole match , " conceded Chang , one of the hottest players on tour this summer with a 16-2 record on hardcourts that included two titles and a runner-up finish .

8619
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:39,000
" Everyone has moments when they get tight .

8620
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Hopefully , this will have been my nerves for the whole tournament . "

8621
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Joining Chang into the second round was Wimbledon runner-up MaliVai Washington , the 11th seed , who also needed four sets to get past talented Moroccan Karim Alami 6-4 2-6 7-6 ( 7-5 ) 6-1 .

8622
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Washington 's win was not comfortable , either .

8623
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:43,000
The 27-year-old American hurried off the Stadium Court for treatment of an upset stomach after his two and a half hour struggle against Alami .

8624
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:44,000
" Towards the end of my match my stomach felt like week-old sushi , " said Washington . "

8625
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Maybe it was a combination of the heat and something I ate . "

8626
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Chang and Washington were the only men 's seeds in action on a day that saw two seeded women 's players fall .

8627
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Australian Open runner-up Anke Huber of Germany , the sixth seed , was undone by an unlucky draw that put her against 17th ranked South African Amanda Coetzer in her opening match .

8628
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Coetzer claimed revenge for the semifinal defeat she suffered to Huber in Melbourne by taking a 6-1 2-6 6-2 victory .

8629
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Last year 's Wimbledon junior champion , Aleksandra Olsza of Poland , removed another seed from the draw by eliminating number 12 Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria 6-4 6-2 .

8630
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,000
Other men 's winners included a pair of former Grand Slam tournament champions whose victories set up a showdown in the second round .

8631
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Germany 's Michael Stich , the 1991 Wimbledon champion , and two-time French Open winner Sergi Bruguera of Spain will face each other next after beating German Tommy Haas 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 , and Belgian Kris Goossens 6-2 6-0 7-6 ( 7-1 ) , respectively .

8632
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Alex O'Brien , who scored his first professional title eight days ago in New Haven , advanced to the second round with a 6-4 1-6 6-4 6-3 win over Ecuador 's Nicolas Lapentti .

8633
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Wimbledon bad boy Jeff Tarango caught a break Monday when he advanced after the retirement of German Alex Radulescu due to heat exhaustion .

8634
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Tarango was leading 6-7 ( 5-7 ) 6-4 6-1 3-1 .

8635
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Chang blamed breezy conditions for some of the erratic play in his match with Oncins , who had beaten him in the round of 32 at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics .

8636
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Chang committed an untidy 53 unforced errors , though he made seven fewer than the Brazilian , who also walloped a woeful 24 double faults .

8637
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:57,000
The most deflating double fault came when Oncins was serving to force a fifth set , leading 6-4 in the tiebreaker .

8638
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:58,000
The set point came after confusion at the net on the point previous , which was awarded to Oncins after the two exchanged shots at close quarters at the net .

8639
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,000
First Chang approached the umpire , then Oncins , then Chang again before play finally resumed .

8640
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,000
" Those little seconds were like an hour to me , " said Oncins , who promptly fired two serves barely contained by the baseline as he frittered away his best chance .

8641
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Chang ran off the next three points to close out the match but for Oncins , the contest was a personal victory .

8642
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:02,000
The 26-year-old Brazilian had risen into the top 30 in 1992 .

8643
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:03,000
The next year a close friend was struck by a stray bullet while riding home in a car from a soccer game in Sao Paulo .

8644
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,000
He died slumped against Oncins , who subsequently lost interest in tennis .

8645
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:05,000
" Two months ago I started talking about quitting , " said Oncins , who decided to give it one last try and made it through the Open qualifying tournament last weekend .

8646
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:06,000
" I believe in my game again , " he said .

8647
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:07,000
At the end of the day , a spate of withdrawals from the tournament were announced .

8648
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Eighth seed Jim Courier withdrew because of a bruised right knee , and 1988 Open champion Mats Wilander bowed out due to a groin pull , organisers said .

8649
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,000
Women 's ninth seed Mary Joe Fernandez pulled out because of tendinitis in her right wrist .

PARIS 1996-08-27

8657
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Former European champions Marseille held French champions Auxerre to a goalless draw in a lacklustre league match on Tuesday .

8658
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:18,000
The bill looked promising but both sides , struggling to find their form early in the season , were disappointing .

8659
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Auxerre , who start their European Cup campaign next week against Ajax Amsterdam , dominated the match but were unable to score .

8660
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Unbeaten in four matches , they still trail leaders Lens by one point .

8661
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Lens , who have won all their three league matches so far , host Montpellier on Wednesday night .

8662
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Despite another dismal performance , especially in defence , Marseille restored some pride by keeping the reigning champions at bay after losing 2-1 at home to Metz last Saturday .

8663
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,000
After two seasons in the second division and after taking on half a dozen new recruits this season , some of whom do not speak a word of French , Marseille are not playing with any fluidity .

8664
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:24,000
But German international goalkeeper Andreas Koepke again proved a sound investment when under pressure from the Auxerre strikers , saving his team with a number of fine parries .

8665
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Marseille now lie seventh in the league on five points .

SOCCER - NEUCHATEL TO APPEAL AGAINST CYPRIEN 'S NINE-MONTH BAN .

8748
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:48,000
GENEVA 1996-08-27

8749
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Swiss league leaders Neuchatel Xamax said on Tuesday they would appeal against a nine-month ban imposed on French international defender Jean-Pierre Cyprien for his part in a post-match brawl .

8750
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Cyprien , also fined 10,000 Swiss francs ( $ 8,400 ) , traded punches with St Gallen 's Brazilian player Claudio Moura after a match on Saturday .

8751
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,000
When officials and coaching staff tried to intervene , Cyprien launched a flying kick at Moura , but only succeeded in kneeing St Gallen coach Roger Hegi in the stomach .

8752
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Moura , who appeared to have elbowed Cyprien in the final minutes of the 3-0 win by Neuchatel , was suspended for seven matches and fined 1,000 francs ( $ 840 ) by the Swiss league disciplinary committee .

8753
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:53,000
Club president Gilbert Facchinetti said he was astonished the committee had arrived at its decision so quickly and vowed the club would appeal .

8754
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Neuchatel coach Gilbert Gress described the incident as " shocking " , but said Moura was also to blame .

8755
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:55,000
" Moura physically and verbally provoked Cyprien during the match .

8756
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:56,000
The referee could not have seen it or he would have punished him , " Gress said .

8757
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:57,000
" During the scuffle , Moura threw the first punch .

8758
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Tomorrow , if someone punches me , I would not know how to react . "

8759
02:25:58,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Cyprien , who won his one French cap against Italy in February 1994 , cannot play in Switzerland or elsewhere until May next year .

CYCLING - BUGNO CLEARED OF DOPING .

8761

MILAN 1996-08-27

8762
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Veteran Italian Gianni Bugno has been cleared of doping after testing positive for high levels of testosterone during the Tour of Switzerland in June , the Italian cycling federation said on Tuesday .

8763
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:03,000
" He has been cleared .

8764
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:04,000
The case is closed , " a spokesman said .

8765
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Bugno tested positive for the banned hormone after the fifth stage of the Tour , in which he finished third overall .

8766
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:06,000
But the spokesman said subsequent tests in Cologne proved his body produced higher-than-average testosterone levels naturally .

8767
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Bugno , who won the Giro d'Italia in 1990 and two successive world titles , was banned for three months in 1994 after testing positive for the stimulant caffeine .

8794

BUDAPEST 1996-08-27

8795
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Expectations that Cofinec S.A. , the Hungarian bourse 's first foreign listing , will report a disappointing first half have depressed the stock below its issue price , but analysts expect a rebound in the long term .

8796
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:36,000
" The first half of the year is unlikely to be as strong as expected so the company will probably be unable to reach its annual plan in 1996 , " said Gabor Sitanyi , a London-based analyst for ING Barings .

8797
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,000
The French-registered packaging materials company , which floated its shares in Hungary in July , for most of the past two weeks hovered below the 6,425 forints / Global Depositary Receipts price of its initial offering , which was oversubscribed .

8798
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:38,000
The company , which asked for a two-week delay from the usual August 15 deadline for reporting first-half results , closed on Tuesday at 5,800 forints , down 300 .

8799
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,000
" Cofinec 's first-half figures will be ...

8800
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:40,000
between one-third of two-fifths of its annual plan , " said Tamas Erdei , a Budapest-based analyst for ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett .

8801
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Analysts blame , at least partly , Hungary 's macroeconomic environment for the weaker figures for Cofinec which , operating in Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic , now generates about 55 to 60 percent of its annual sales from Hungary .

8802
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Hungary 's Gross Domestic Product fell one percentage point in the first quarter while real wages plunged 7.2 percentage points in the first half of 1996 .

8803
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Both will have their impact on Cofinec 's figures , the analysts said .

8804
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Despite the current difficulties , however , analysts were convinced that Cofinec 's outlook was strong .

8805
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:45,000
" The eastern European market offers good chances , " said Erdei . "

8806
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Just like many other companies on the bourse , Cofinec has big growth opportunities . "

8807
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:47,000
" At the same time , it 's an advantage for Cofinec that it has a foreign management which perhaps understands the market better , " Erdei added .

8808
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:48,000
" Cofinec is a very good story in the long-term as the per capita packaging consumption is still so low in east Europe that a very strong increase can be expected ( long-term ) , " Sitanyi said , saying that several recent moves by Cofinec boosted its position .

8809
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Among them , he noted that Cofinec had acquired the outstanding stake in its Czech folding company Krpaco a.s. , increasing its ownership to 100 percent , so in the second half the whole of Krpaco 's figures will be consolidated .

8810
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:50,000
The company also repaid some $ 21 million of debt , well above the originally planned $ 8 million to $ 9 million .

8811
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:51,000
In addition , its Polish operation began with some six weeks of delay due to cold winter weather and the test run was also longer than planned .

02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:35,000
The Chicago Board Options Exchange ( CBOE ) said on Tuesday it was doing a routine investigation into trading in options on MFS Communications Co Inc shares .

8856
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:36,000
On Monday , the company said it had agreed to be acquired by WorldCom Inc in a deal valued at $ 14 billion .

8857
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:37,000
MFS shares surged on the news while WorldCom fell on fears of dilution .

8858
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:38,000
The New York Times said on Tuesday some of the options trading in MFS last Friday may suggest insider trading .

8859
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,000
MFS options also trade on the American Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange .

8860
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:40,000
A spokesman for the American Stock Exchange would neither confirm or deny whether the exchange was looking into trading .

8861
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,000
" If there is unusual activity , certainly we look at it , but that 's not to say we 're doing anything official , " he said .

8862
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Pacific Stock Exchange officials were not available .

8863
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:43,000
One trader said trading in MFS options had increased steadily from about mid-August , and doubted whether any of last Friday 's activity was insider trading .

8867
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:47,000
Faulding Inc said on Tuesday Purdue Frederick Co filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Faulding and its Purepac Pharamceutical unit .

8868
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:48,000
The suit was filed because of Purepac 's manufacture of Kadian , a sustained release morphine product , Faulding said .

8869
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Faulding said the claims in the lawsuit are without merit and will not impact upon the launch of Kadian in the United States .

8870
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Kadian was approved for sale in the United States last month , Faulding said .

8871
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:51,000
Zeneca Group Plc , which will market Kadian , was named in the lawsuit with F.H. Faulding & Co , the majority shareholder of Faulding Inc , the company said .

Ireland 's most experienced player , defender Paul McGrath , was left out of the national squad for the first time in 11 years on Tuesday when new manager Mick McCarthy named his side to face Liechtenstein in a World Cup qualifier .

8875
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,000
The 36-year-old Aston Villa player won the last of his Irish record of 82 international caps against the Czech Republic in Prague in April .

8876
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:56,000
" Paul accepted the situation .

8877
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:57,000
He has n't played any first-team games for Villa this season and he 's not the type of player I would have brought on as a substitute , " McCarthy said . "

8878
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:58,000
But he surprised me in training over the last two days because of his involvement .

8879
02:27:58,000 --> 02:27:59,000
He 's certainly is still very much part of my plans for the future .

8880
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,000
" At 24 , 25 or 26 you could get away with it , not having played first-team games .

8881
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:01,000
But at 36 it would be asking too much of Paul , " he said .

8882
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:02,000
Also omitted from the 20-man squad which will travel to Vaduz for Saturday 's group eight match are central defenders Alan Kernaghan and Liam Daish .

8884
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Since taking over from Jack Charlton in February , McCarthy has played largely experimental sides and seen them lose five times , draw twice and win just once .

South African apartheid killer Eugene de Kock was found guilty of murder and attempted murder on Tuesday , a day after he was convicted of five other murders .

8890
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:10,000

8894
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:14,000
The main rebel group in south Sudan said on Tuesday it was trying to arrange the release of six Roman Catholic missionaries , including three Australian nuns , held for nearly two weeks .

8895
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,000
George Garang , Nairobi spokesman for the Sudan People 's Liberation Army ( SPLA ) , said it was urgently trying to contact SPLA commander Nuour Marial at Mapourdit in the south to free the six .

8896
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:16,000
" The movement is making arrangements for them to be set free .

8897
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,000
This is a decision of the leadership , " Garang said .

8898
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:18,000
" Commander Nuour Marial is a soldier so he must accept the leadership 's decision .

8899
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:19,000
But communications at this time of year are very difficult because of rains and a lack of power , " he added .

8900
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:20,000
The Catholic Information Office in Nairobi said on Monday that four of the six had been charged by the SPLA with spying , spreading Islam and hindering recruitment into the rebel group .

8901
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:21,000
" These charges are the interpretation of the church , " Garang said on Tuesday . "

8902
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:22,000
We have no idea why they are being held .

8903
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,000
We are still trying to establish contact with the local commander . "

8904
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Asked whether this meant the commander was out of control , Garang said the rebel movement was working on the problem .

8905
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,000
He said he believed all six were being held in the mission compound at Mapourdit and were reported to be in good health .

8906
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:26,000
The Catholic Information office in Nairobi said on Monday that Australian Sisters Moira Lynch , 73 , and Mary Batchelor , 68 , American Father Michael Barton , 48 , and Sudanese Father Raphael Riel , 48 , were held in a prison in south Sudan by the SPLA .

8907
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:27,000
It said Australian Sister Maureen Carey , 52 , and Italian Brother Raniero Iacomella , 28 , were held inside the compound .

8908
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:28,000
The church in Australia said on Monday Lynch , Batchelor , Barton and Riel were held in a prison until the weekend , when they were moved to join the other captives at the compound .

8909
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:29,000
The Catholic Information Office said the SPLA in the Kenyan capital had attributed the detentions of the six to a local commander and had promised they would be freed by August 23 .

8910
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,000
But the church learned in a recent meeting with the local commander that no instructions to release the prisoners were received and they would be held until investigations were completed .

8911
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:31,000
It said last Friday they were visited by Monsignor Caesar Mazzolari , apostolic administrator of the diocese of Rumbek in southern Sudan , and an SPLA administrator and appeared in good condition .

8912
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
" On August 17 the mission was surrounded ( by the SPLA ) and sealed off .

8913
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:33,000
The evening of the same day the missionaries were put in prison or isolation .

8914
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Later the mission was looted , " it added .

8915
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:35,000
An Australian foreign ministry official said the charges against them were " fairly bizarre " and a matter for concern .

8916
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:36,000
He said Australian diplomats in Nairobi were working with the Roman Catholic church in southern Sudan and with U.S. and Italian diplomats in the region to help free the missionaries .

8917
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:37,000
The SPLA has fought Khartoum 's government forces in the south since 1983 for greater autonomy or independence of the mainly Christian and animist region from the Moslem , Arabised north .

SARAJEVO 1996-08-27

8920
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:40,000
The U.S. diplomat in charge of elections in Bosnia announced on Tuesday that voting for municipal assemblies would be postponed because of irregularities by the Serbs in registering voters .

8921
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Ambassador Robert Frowick , representing the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , told reporters that municipal polls due on September 14 with other Bosnian elections would be put off .

8922
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:42,000
" I have made a chairman 's decision that it is not feasible to hold municipal elections on September 14 , " said Frowick .

8923
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:43,000
He said no exact date had been set but it was possible the local elections would take place in the spring of 1997 .

8924
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:44,000
According to OSCE officials , Serb authorities have pressed their refugees to register to vote in towns now under Serb control , but which used to have Moslem majorities .

8925
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Human rights workers say authorities in Serbia and Bosnian Serb territory have conducted a well-organised campaign to coerce refugees into registering only on Serb territory and failed to inform them of their rights under the Dayton peace agreement .

8926
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Diplomats say the effect of the electoral engineering would be to establish political control over districts they conquered and ethnically cleansed in war .

8927
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,000
The response of the Bosnian Serbs to the OSCE 's announcement was not immediately clear .

8928
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:48,000
But Bosnian Serb leaders have hinted they would boycott the poll if the municipal elections were postponed , or go ahead with their own .

8929
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,000
The Bosnian Serb cabinet , in a letter to the OSCE , said on Monday that any delay of local elections would be " a direct and flagrant violation fo the Dayton agreement " .

8930
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:50,000
The Serbs , who administer half of Bosnia in a Serb republic , said they had met all conditions for holding the September elections .

8931
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Diplomats fear that the crisis could cast doubt over the entire election process , which already appears set to confirm Bosnia 's ethnic partition rather than its reintegration as the Dayton peace agreement had planned .

8935
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Russian and rebel military commanders finally met in Chechnya on Tuesday for delayed talks aimed at finalising a ceasefire arranged last week by President Boris Yeltsin 's envoy Alexander Lebed .

8936
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:56,000
The Russian army commander in the region , General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov , arrived at the rebel-held village of Novye Atagi , some 20 km ( 12 miles ) south of the Chechen capital Grozny for discussions with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov .

8937
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,000
But Lebed himself , the Kremlin security chief , is still waiting back in Moscow to meet Yeltsin over his plans for a lasting political settlement in Chechnya .

8938
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Kremlin press service as saying Yeltsin , who left for a state holiday home near Moscow on Monday , would hold no working meetings on Tuesday .

8939
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Lebed interrupted talks with Chechnya 's separatists on a political deal on Sunday , saying he had to consult with Yeltsin .

8940
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:00,000
After a meeting failed to materialise on Monday , Lebed 's spokesman said he might meet the president on Tuesday .

8941
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,000
But Yeltsin 's spokesman rebuffed the suggestion , saying the president had left Moscow for a holiday near the capital .

8942
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:02,000
The Russians postponed the talks after a Chechen band disarmed a column of interior ministry troops on Sunday .

8943
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:03,000
The Chechens said a renegade group seized the weapons and said on Monday they had all been returned .

8944
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:04,000
The Russian command insisted that not all the weapons were the same as those taken .

8945
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Tass said the weapons and the practical implementation of the ceasefire signed by Lebed and Maskhadov last Thursday would be on the agenda of today 's talks .

8946
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Neither spoke to reporters before the meeting , which started around 10.45 a.m. ( 0645 GMT ) .

8947
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Also in Novye Atagi on Tuesday morning , was Tim Guldimann , the Swiss diplomat who heads the Chechnya mission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) .

8948
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Guldimann , who helped broker an earlier truce in May , was not taking part in the Tikhomirov-Maskhadov talks .

8949
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Lebed 's peace mission this month has stopped some of the worst fighting of the 20-month-old conflict .

8950
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:10,000
However , tension on the ground indicates that it could falter if the momentum for a settlement is not maintained .

8951
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Three Russian servicemen were wounded in a total of six shooting incidents overnight , Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Russian military as saying on Tuesday morning .

8952
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:12,000
RIA news agency quoted an army source accusing rebel fighters of failing to turn up for joint Russian-Chechen police patrols in some districts of the capital Grozny on Tuesday .

8953
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,000
But the separatist command told Interfax news agency the patrols , part of the truce brokered by Lebed last week , would begin on Tuesday after delays for " technical reasons " .

8954
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Yeltsin 's spokesman said he might meet officials during his break , but indicated Lebed was low on the list by saying Yeltsin would need time to study the proposals before talking to him .

8955
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Russian news agencies also quoted the Kremlin spokesman as saying that Lebed 's representatives had not sought a meeting , hinting at an attempt by the president to put his popular and outspoken protege in his place with a lesson on protocol .

8956
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Yeltsin , 65 , has kept a low profile since he was reelected in July , prompting new speculation that the two heart attacks he suffered last year and a rumoured drinking problem could be taking their toll , weakening his grip on affairs of state .

8957
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Aides have dismissed such speculation , insisting that he simply needs a rest after his energetic election campaign .

8958
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Some analysts say the Kremlin leader , whose order sending troops and tanks into Chechnya in 1994 started Russia 's ill-fated military campaign , could merely be reluctant to put his name to a peace process which might fall apart .

8959
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:19,000
But Lebed , who has no real power without his boss and has hinted at dark forces in Moscow working against him , appears to think a deal will not stick without strong backing from Yeltsin .

8960
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:20,000
His proposals have not been spelled out but are expected to involve a compromise between the separatists ' demand for independence and Moscow 's insistence that Chechnya remain part of the Russian Federation .

Slovenia and Poland pledged to intensify cooperation on Tuesday and reinforced their determination to join the European Union and NATO at the earliest possible date .

8964
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski and his Slovenian counterpart , Milan Kucan , met for talks at the start of a two-day visit to Slovenia by Kwasniewski .

8965
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:25,000
It was their fourth meeting this year .

8966
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:26,000
They said in a statement they agreed to have regular telephone contact to discuss progress in strengthening ties with the West .

8967
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,000
" We expect our cooperation will help both countries towards entering the European Union and NATO , " Kwasniewski said .

8968
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,000
" We have similar ambitions as far as our internal development and international life is concerned , " Kucan said .

Poland and Slovenia are hoping to be among the first group of former eastern bloc countries to join the European Union and NATO .

8970
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:30,000
They have already signed an association agreement with the European Union and are both part of the Central European Free Trade Area , which also comprises Hungary , Slovakia and the Czech Republic .

8971
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:31,000
Slovenia 's trade with Poland rose to $ 142.3 million in 1995 from $ 118.8 million in 1994 .

BUCHAREST 1996-08-27

8975
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Junior Nationalist members of Romania 's ruling coalition called on Tuesday for the impeachment of President Ion Iliescu for backing a friendship treaty with neighbouring Hungary .

8976
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Iliescu 's Party of Social Democracy , the senior coalition partner , immediately dismissed the National Unity Party ( PUNR ) demand as crude electioneering .

8977
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:37,000
" It is a desperate move by the PUNR , which is losing its only reason for existing ahead of the electoral campaign , " said PDSR executive president Adrian Nastase .

8978
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:38,000
" This treaty is both necessary and good , " Nastase said , adding that the PUNR 's stance was threatening its position in the government .

8979
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:39,000
The treaty agreed unexpectedly two weeks ago will end years of disputes over the status of Romania 's large ethnic Hungarian minority .

8980
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:40,000
It will also boost both countries ' chances of admission to NATO and the European Union .

8981
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:41,000
" If they ( the PUNR ) are so vexed , they could leave the government ...

8982
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,000
We might also help them to do it , if they go on like this , " he said .

8983
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:43,000
The PUNR holds four key ministries -- justice , transport , agriculture and communications .

8984
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:44,000
PUNR leader Gheorghe Funar said in a statement Iliescu , in power since the fall of communism in 1989 , should be impeached for treason for compromising on the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority rights in the treaty due to be signed next month .

8985
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Funar 's call came on the eve of the official launch of Iliescu 's campaign for a new term at November 3 polls .

8986
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,000
His appeal to the opposition to back his attempt to oust Iliescu was unlikely to succeed , analysts said .

8987
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Iliescu has invited political leaders to a meeting on Thursday to discuss the final form of the pact which both Romanian and Hungarian nationalists oppose for different reasons .

8988
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Presidential officials were not available to comment on the call for Iliescu 's impeachment .

TALLINN 1996-08-27

8992
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:52,000
Estonia 's parliament failed for a second time to elect a president on Tuesday , dealing a blow to incumbent Lennart Meri and pushing the country towards stalemate in its choice of a new head of state .

8993
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Neither Meri , who oversaw Estonia 's first steps into statehood after the collapse of the Soviet Union , nor his arch-rival , former communist Arnold Ruutel , have secured the 68 votes necessary from the 101-member parliament .

8994
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Meri garnered 49 votes and Meri 34 in Tuesday 's ballot for the five-year presidency of Estonia .

8995
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:55,000
A third and final vote was due to be held when parliament reconvened on Tuesday but legislators were not expecting a clear result .

8996
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:56,000
If there is no result the decision will be ceded to an electoral college .

8997
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:57,000
" The votes are a strong message to Meri that he is not favoured by some politicians any more , " Reform Party head Heiki Kranich told Reuters .

8998
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Under a constitution agreed in 1992 , a year after independence , the president has no executive powers .

8999
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,000
His only political role is to smoothe the functioning of government in periods of crisis .

9000
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,000
But Meri , 67 , has been accused in parliament of taking too much power and not always consulting parliamentarians before making decisions .

9001
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:01,000
His relations with a leftist-led government have sometimes been tense .

9002
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:02,000
His support in the first round of voting on Monday was much lower than expected , scoring only 45 votes , which political analysts put down as a vote of no confidence in his performance .

9003
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:03,000
This support only inched up to 49 in the second vote .

9004
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Support for Ruutel , 68 , remained constant at 34 votes .

9005
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:05,000
If the third vote fails to give either Meri or Ruutel 68 votes , the parliamentary speaker will convene an electoral college of 101 MPs and 273 local goverment representatives to hold a new poll that could include new nominations .

9006
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:06,000
This would be the first time that the former Soviet republic has had to call together an electoral college .

9007
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:07,000
In its first presidential election in 1992 Meri won the necessary votes in in a parliamentary election against Ruutel .

9008
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Parliamentary organisers said the exact timetable remained unclear but it would probably take about a month to organise an electoral college which could also hold several rounds of voting before a clear winner emerges .

9009

Estonia assembly fails to elect state president .

TALLINN 1996-08-27

9011
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:11,000
The Estonian parliament failed for a third and final time to elect a new state president on Tuesday , refusing a second mandate for incumbent Lennart Meri .

9012
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Neither Meri nor his rival Arnold Ruutel could garner the 68 votes needed from the 101 members of parliament to become president .

9013
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:13,000
In the third vote Meri won 52 and Ruutel won 32 votes .

9014
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:14,000
The final decision will now be made by a larger assembly .

9015
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:15,000
Meri won 49 in a second vote earlier on Tuesday and 45 in the first on Monday .

9016
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Ruutel won 34 votes in the first two secret ballots .

9017
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Enn Markvart , chairman of the National Election Commission said 96 members of parliament cast votes , with one ballot paper invalid and 11 abstentions .

9018
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:18,000
The election will now go before an electoral college involving MPs and local government representatives that will be convened by the parliamentary Speaker in the next day or so .

9019
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:19,000
It could take up to a month before a new vote but the timetable is not yet clear .

9020
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:20,000
This is the first time the former Soviet republic has had to convene such a group .

9023
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Albanian authorities have arrested and charged a British man for sexually abusing two young boys , a Tirana prosecutor said on Tuesday .

9024
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:24,000
" We have arrested him and charged him with these shameful acts of sex abuse of little children , " prosecutor Adnan Xhelili told Reuters .

9025
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Xhelili said Paul Thompson , 34 , from Wiltshire , was arrested on Sunday in a hotel in the Adriatic resort of Durres , 45 km ( 30 miles ) west of Tirana .

9026
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Thompson has denied the charges .

9027
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:27,000
He could face up to five years in jail if convicted .

9028
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Xhelili said Thompson , who is divorced , said he befriended the boys , both aged under 10 , because they reminded him of his own children who live with his former wife in London .

9029
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:29,000
The prosecutor 's office said no date had yet been set for a trial to begin as investigations had first to be completed .

9030
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:30,000
The British embassy in Tirana said it had sent an embassy official to talk to Thompson who is being held in jail .

TALLINN 1996-08-27

9035
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Estonia 's parliament again failed to elect a new state president on Tuesday when neither of two candidates secured a majority in second-round voting .

9036
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Incumbent president Lennart Meri won 49 votes compared to 34 won by his rival , deputy Parliamentary Speaker Arnold Ruutel .

9037
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:37,000
But Meri 's support was not enough for the 68 needed for election and a third secret ballot will take place later in the day ( 1300 GMT ) , parliamentary officials said .

9038
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:38,000
To win a clear mandate for the five-year presidential term , a candidate must secure 68 votes from the 101-member parliament .

9039
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Enn Markvart , Chairman of the National Election Commission , said 96 members of parliament voted in the second round , with 12 abstentions and one ballot paper invalid .

9040
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:40,000
On Monday , in the first round of voting , Meri secured 45 votes and Ruutel 34 .

9041
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Meri 's popularity has suffered in recent years , with politicians criticising him for taking too much power and acting without consulting parliament .

9042
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:42,000
If a third round of voting fails to give either candidate 68 votes , the parliamentary speaker has to convene an electoral college of all 101 MPs and 273 local government representatives for a new vote that could take up to a month .

Marc Dutroux , the chief accused in Belgium 's sensational child murder and sex abuse case , visited Slovakia a number of times and about 10 young Slovak women went to Belgium at his invitation , police said on Tuesday .

9047
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:47,000
But they have difficulty remembering what happened there , perhaps because of drugs , and are unsure whether they were filmed for pornography , Rudolf Gajdos , head of the Slovak office of Interpol , told Reuters .

9048
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Although Gajdos spoke of " girls " his deputy , Eva Boudova , said the case involved about 10 young women in their early 20s .

9049
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:49,000
" The police interrogated several Slovak girls who said that they had been invited by Mark Dutroux to visit Belgium , " Gajdos said .

9050
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:50,000
" The girls said they went to Belgium voluntarily and the police suspect that they were used to act in pornographic films . "

9051
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:51,000
" The police suspect ( the girls ) were under the influence of drugs as some girls admitted they took unspecified pills . "

9052
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:52,000
" We have suspicions of a rape , but the police still have to find the victim , " Gajdos added .

9053
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:53,000
Dutroux 's last visit to Slovakia was reported to have been as recent as July .

9054

Slovak police are also cooperating with Belgium in the search for An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks , who went missing last August .

Dutroux , 39 , who was charged last week with the abduction and illegal imprisonment of two other girls aged 14 and 12 , is one of several suspects in the Marchal and Lambrecks case .

9056
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Last Saturday he led police to the bodies of two other girls , aged eight , who died of starvation this year after their abduction in June , 1995 .

9057
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,000
The Czech office of Interpol said on Friday it would neither confirm nor deny that Dutroux had been in the Czech Republic , Slovakia 's western neighbour and former federation partner .

9058
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Belgian police said an officer had visited Bratislava to talk with Slovak detectives about An and Eefje and other disappearances , and he planned to go also to Prague .

Tass said the talks were taking place in the settlement of Novye Atagi , some 20 km ( 12 miles ) south of the Chechen capital Grozny .

9073
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:13,000
The talks had been postponed while the Russians waited for the rebels to return arms and ammunition seized from Russian soldiers at the weekend .

" But before going , I would have big signs put up in all government offices , those to do with justice , in all sectors , with the Ten Commandments , " he added .

9096
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:36,000
We 're looking at a criminal act that has no political aspect as far as what we can tell , " Schutte added .

9097
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,000
A note with the ransom demand was left in the couple 's car , which was used in the kidnapping , Schutte told a news conference on Monday .

9098
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:38,000

A swell of protest is growing within Venezuela 's trade unions at the proposed year-end privatization of the state-owned holding company Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana ( CVG ) , CVG union leaders said Tuesday .

9107
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:47,000
" We oppose the way the government is proceeding with the sale , " Ramon Machuca , Sidor trade union Secretary General and member of union-based opposition party Radical Cause , told reporters .

9108
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:48,000
" We do n't believe the government will make its timetable , " he added .

9109
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Sidor is the CVG 's steel-producing arm , slated for a December sale worth an estimated $ 1.5 billion .

9110
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:50,000
The CVG 's aluminum companies Venalum and Alucasa are also scheduled to be sold early 1997 .

9111
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Arguing that CVG 's privatization would result in some 13,000 layoffs , compared to the government 's estimated 1,500 , CVG 's union leaders told reporters they would strike and stage protests if their concerns were not addressed .

9112
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:52,000
" We oppose any privatization that hurts workers ' welfare and does not take into account its social impact , " they said .

9113
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:53,000
The opposition party Radical Cause controls all of the unionized workers at the CVG heavy industry complex and has systematically opposed all government legislation in congress .

Heavy drinkers in a Nicaraguan city were searching for someone who has covered them in " lovebites " while they were passed out in a drunken stupor , a local newspaper reported on Tuesday .

9118
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:58,000
The dreaded " chupabolos " -- " drunksucker " -- preys on men who have passed out in the streets of Matagalpa , 80 miles ( 130 kms ) north of Managua , placing hickey-like " lovebites " on various parts of their bodies , El Nuevo Diario reported .

9119
02:31:58,000 --> 02:31:59,000
Enraged drunks and street people in this town known for its machismo have organised a so-far unsuccessful search for the culprit who finds victims in the dark streets surrounding a local market .

9120
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:00,000
The total number of victims was still unknown .

9121
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:01,000
The first of the victims were two vagrants who slept in an abandoned car in front of a local bank , the newspaper said .

9122
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:02,000
In spite of the collective fear gripping Matagalpa 's drinkers , local women expressed little sympathy .

9123
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:03,000
" Its just desserts for all the ' bolos ' ( drunkards ) who sleep in the streets of our beautiful town , " said a woman who worked in the local market .

9126
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Brazil is likely to turn Sao Paulo state bank Banespa into a federal bank in a prior step to privatization , according to unnamed government sources , O Globo daily said .

9127
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:07,000
The newspaper said the Central Bank special administration of Banespa ends in December 30 and after that the bank has to be liquidated or turned into a federal bank since there are no conditions to return Banespa to Sao Paulo state government .

9128
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:08,000
A Central Bank spokesman said he could not confirm or deny the report .

9129
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:09,000
Banespa has been under central bank special temporary administration since December 1994 .

9130
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:10,000
The central bank management could be lifted if Sao Paulo state decided to take part in the recent federal government 's plan to restructure state banks .

9131
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Under the plan , the federal government would provide 100 percent of the financing needed to restructure debt of state banks being privatized , liquidated or turned into development banks .

9132
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:12,000
It also offers to refinance up to 50 percent of the debt held by state banks whose governments decide to keep control of their banks .

9133
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Although the plan was designed under terms proposed by Sao Paulo state governor Mario Covas , he has showed no interest in taking part in the plan because Sao Paulo 's debt with Banespa has increased sharply , O Globo said .

9134
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Sao Paulo state 's debt is now estimated at 19 billion reais .

9135
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:15,000
O Globo also said another delicate case to be solved involves private bank Bamerindus .

9136
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:16,000
The newspaper said Bamerindus has sent to the Central Bank a proposal for restructuring combined with a request for a 90-day credit line , paying four percent a year plus the Basic Interest Rate of the Central Bank ( TBC ) .

9137
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:17,000
O Globo also said the loan would give Bamerindus time to sell assets .

9138
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:18,000
Bamerindus , Brazil 's fourth-largest private bank , has been facing liquidity troubles .

9139
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Bamerindus declined to comment on negotiations being held with the Central Bank .

9149
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:29,000
Alejandro Lanusse , the former dictator who ruled Argentina for two years , died at age 78 on Monday .

9150
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Lanusse died after being brought to a hospital a week ago following a fall at home that resulted in a blood clot in the brain .

9151
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:31,000
He was operated on earlier in the week but failed to recover from surgery .

9152
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:32,000
The former dictator , who ruled from 1971 to 1973 , was best known for allowing Juan Domingo Peron , Argentina 's famed populist leader , to return to Argentina after 17 years of forced exile .

9153
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Lanusse took over the leadership of the country after five years of dictatorship .

9154
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:34,000
But unlike his two predecessors , Juan Carlos Ongania and Marcelo Levingston , who ruled Argentina with an iron hand , Lanusse steered the country toward democracy .

9155
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:35,000
That resulted in general elections in March 1973 when the Peronists led by Hector Campora and Vicente Solano Lima returned to power .

9156
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Lanusse was a candidate in the election but failed to defeat his old adversories and never returned to public office .

9157
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:37,000
He was imprisoned for four years in 1951 for taking part in a coup attempt to overthrow Peron led by General Benjamin Menendez .

9158
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Lanusse 's rule saw the gradual rise of left-wing activism which culminated in another period of brutal Argentine dictatorship from 1976 to 1983 , during which the military launched its " dirty war " that resulted in 10,000 missing people .

9159
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:39,000
In his autobiography published in 1990 , Lanusse described himself as a military man with " democratic ideas . "

9211

Iraq 's partial oil sales pact with U.N. , allowing crude exports worth $ 2 billion every six months , gives U.N. the right to supervise the purchase and distribution of food supplies in the country .

9212
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:32,000
The deal is a humanitarian exception to the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990 which include a ban on its oil exports .

02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Casey told a news conference in Chicago on Tuesday he had asked to speak again this year but was turned down .

9236
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Democratic leaders said there was not room on the program for every retired governor to speak .

9237
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:57,000
" I believe the Democratic party ought to be pro-woman , pro-child and pro-life , " Casey said .

9238
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:58,000
" I asked for the opportunity to deliver this message from the podium of the Democrat National Convention .

9239
02:33:58,000 --> 02:33:59,000
For the second time in four years , my request fell on deaf ears , " he said .

9240
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:00,000
The Republican Party , whose platform calls for making all abortions illegal , faced a similar dilemma this year when Massachusetts Gov .

9241
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:01,000
William Weld asked to deliver a speech defending abortion rights and was turned down .

9242
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Bob Dole , the Republican presidential nominee , tried and failed to insert a tolerance clause in his party 's platform recognizing the validity of those within the party who supported abortion rights .

9243
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:03,000
Democrats also heard Tuesday two passionate speeches defending abortion rights .

9244
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:04,000

9245
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,000
" I 'm here to speak up for choice and to speak for truth .

9246
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:06,000
The message from the Republican Party is one of disdain .

9247
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Their answer to choice is control and punishment .

9248
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:08,000

9321
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:21,000
The poll , taken on Sunday and Monday as the president engaged in a whistle-stop train trip to the Democratic Convention in Chicago , put Clinton at 51 percent , Dole at 36 percent and Ross Perot of the Reform Party at 8 percent .

9322
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:22,000

Dole , down by around 20 points in early August in ABC polls , had closed to within four percentage points immediately after the Republican convention in San Diego earlier in August .

9324
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Other polls also showed a strong Dole bounce after San Diego but Clinton then rebuilding his lead .

9325
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:25,000
Tuesday 's poll involved 1,002 registered voters and had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points .

9326
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:26,000
ABC said a parallel poll of 824 likely voters showed the president ahead by 11 points , with Clinton at 50 percent , Dole at 39 percent and Perot at 6 percent .

9327
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,000

9676
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:16,000

Sarah Brady , whose Republican husband was severely disabled in an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan , took centre stage at the Democratic National convention on Monday night to praise President Bill Clinton 's gun control efforts .

9702
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:42,000
With her husband James sitting in a wheelchair to the side of the podium , Mrs. Brady called the handgun control bill that a Democratic Congress passed and Clinton signed in 1994 a major step in controlling firearm violence in the United States .

9703
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:43,000
But she said more had to be done .

9704
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:44,000
The Bradys walked on to the stage , he on her arm and with the aid of a cane , to a rousing reception from the convention .

9705
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Their teenaged son sat in a VIP box with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and watched as his father returned to his wheelchair .

9706
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:46,000
" Jim , we must have made a wrong turn .

9707
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:47,000
This is n't San Diego ( site of the Republican convention ) , " Mrs. Brady joked to her husband , who was serving as Reagan 's press secretary when he was shot .

9708
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:48,000
" Sarah , I told you this is the Democratic convention , " he responded to his wife , who before the shooting had worked for two Republican congressmen and the Republican national party .

9709
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:49,000
" Since the Brady Law went into effect on February 28 , 1994 ( it ) has stopped more than 100,000 convicted felons and other prohibited purchasers from buying a handgun .

9710
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Today , and every day , the Brady Law is stopping an estimated 85 felons from buying a handgun , " Mrs. Brady said .

9711
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:51,000
She added , " But we need to do more .

9712
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:52,000
We should , as President Clinton proposed today , stop people convicted of domestic violence from buying a handgun .

9713
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:53,000
Jim and I join with you tonight in saluting the great job that President Clinton has done in fighting crime and gun violence . "

9714
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:54,000
" He 's a hunter and a sportsman , but he understands the difference between a Remington rifle and an AK47 .

9715
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:55,000
And he knows that you do n't go hunting with an Uzi .

9716
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Mr. President you deserve our thanks . "

9717
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Jim Brady then gave a big thumbs to the audience .

9718
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Brady

9719
02:41:58,000 --> 02:41:59,000
was shot in the head in 1981 by gunman John Hinckley , who tried to kill Reagan in a deranged bid to impress Jodie Foster , an actress he never met but with whom he was obsessed .

9720
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:00,000
The Brady bill , calling for a waiting period before someone could buy a gun so a background check could be made , was first introduced in Congress in 1987 but it took seven years to pass because of opposition from the National Rifle Association gun lobby .

Armed hijackers believed to be Iraqis released 140 people on Tuesday from a Sudan Airways plane carrying 199 passengers and crew that landed in London after being diverted on a flight from Khartoum to Amman , police said .

9754
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Police spokesman Roger Grimwade said the six or seven hijackers remained on board the aircraft , which arrived from Cyprus at 4.30 a.m. ( 0330 GMT ) .

9755
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:35,000
He said they had made various requests to police negotiators but stepped back from earlier suggestions that the hijackers had asked to speak to a British-based Iraqi police named as Mr Sadiki .

9756
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:36,000
The hijackers , who have said they want to seek asylum in Britain , are believed to be armed with grenades and possibly other explosives , according to police .

A hijacked Sudan Airways plane carrying 199 passengers and crew landed at Stansted airport just outside London early on Tuesday morning after flying from Cyprus , eyewitnesses said .

9770
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:50,000
The Airbus 310 Flight 150 , which was hijacked on Monday evening on its way from Khartoum to the Jordanian capital Amman , landed at 4.30 a.m. ( 0330 GMT ) after a flight of more than four hours .

9771
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:51,000
At least one of the unidentified hijackers was apparently armed with grenades and TNT and threatened to blow the plane up in Cyprus unless it was refuelled so they could fly to Britain to claim political asylum .

9772
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:52,000
" They will surrender the passengers there and surrender themselves , " police spokesman Glafcos Xenos told reporters at Cyprus 's Larnaca airport .

9774
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Stansted has been designated as the preferred option for handling hijackings in southern England because it is more remote than Heathrow and Gatwick , London 's two major airports , and handles less air traffic .

02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:01,000
British officials said they would much prefer to deal with a hijacking at Stansted because of its relatively remote location and because air traffic would be less badly disrupted there than at Heathrow or Gatwick .

9782
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:02,000
They said police and the emergency services were implementing a well-rehearsed contingency plan to handle the hijacking .

9783
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:03,000
The armed hijackers of the Airbus 310 Flight 150 , which is expected to arrive about 4 a.m. ( 0300 GMT ) , have said they intend to surrender and seek political asylum in Britain .

9784
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:04,000
The plane was hijacked on its way from Khartoum to the Jordanian capital Amman on Monday evening and landed at Larnaca airport in Cyprus to refuel .

9785
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:05,000
The identity and number of the hijackers was not known .

9786
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:06,000
One of them negotiated through the pilot in English .

9787
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:07,000
The pilot said several hijackers appeared to be placed around the plane .

Painted parrot scam lands Australian in jail .

PERTH , Australia 1996-08-27

9790
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:10,000
A conman who painted common Australian parrots with dye to make them look like rare birds worth thousands of dollars was jailed for fraud on Tuesday .

9791
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:11,000
Denham Peiris painted six green parrots , worth about A$ 100 ( US$ 79 ) a pair , with a cinnamon hair dye and traded them as Indian Ringneck Parrots , valued at A$ 14,000 a pair .

9792
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Peiris , 32 , of Perth , was sentenced in the Western Australian District Court to two years in jail for fraud after trading three pairs of impostor birds for 21 parrots worth a total of A$ 28,000 .

9793
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:13,000
" Everyone was fooled , " said pet shop owner Shane Drew , who unknowingly traded the disguised birds .

9794
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:14,000
" I 'd already had three local breeders have a look at them and sent photos and videos of the birds to the eastern states for authentication -- they said they 're nice birds , " Drew told reporters outside court .

9795
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:15,000
" After I was told they were dyed , I checked them over again .

9796
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:16,000
It was a perfect paint job except for one feather under a wing of one bird that was only half dyed , " Drew said .

9797
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,000
Drew said Peiris , a bird enthusiast , would have succeeded with the fraud if he had not tried to trade a fourth pair of bogus birds after an associate had told police of the scam .

9798
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:18,000
If not for the informant , the painted parrots ' true colours would not have been known for six months , he said .

9799
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:19,000
" They moult in the summer , so five or six months down the track , I would have looked like the guilty party , " Drew said .

02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:23,000
The man drew attention to himself in the North Island town of Tauranga while trying to reverse his car out of a pothole on Saturday night .

9804
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:24,000
He spun the wheels so much that the tyres caught alight and smoke began pouring from under the bonnet , the New Zealand Press Association reported .

9805
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:25,000
Police arrested the man and charged him with drink-driving , but then iscovered he was wanted by the Immigration Service as an overstayer .

9816
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:36,000
South Korea has told its overseas missions to step up security since its embassy in the former Yugoslavia received a threat over Seoul 's crackdown on radical students , the foreign ministry said on Tuesday .

9817
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:37,000
A letter to the Belgrade embassy on Monday under the name of the Macedonian Communist Party demanded South Korea release detained student leaders , a ministry spokesman said .

9818
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:38,000
" The letter said the party would assault the embassy , other South Korean-related facilities and Korean nationals unless our authorities released arrested students , " he said .

9819
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:39,000
Nearly 400 members of an outlawed student group were arrested after violent protests demanding reunification with communist North Korea were crushed by riot police at a Seoul university this month .

9820
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:40,000
Authorities branded the violence , in which a police officer was killed , as an act of terror .

9821
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:41,000
" The ministry has ordered the embassy to take urgent security measures against possible terrorist attacks , " the official said , asking not to be named .

9822
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:42,000
It had called for similar precautions at other overseas missions , including those in Canada and Bangladesh where leftist groups have staged protests over the crackdown .

9825
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:45,000
China on Tuesday reaffirmed its support for a global nuclear test ban treaty blocked by India last week , saying the pact would be an important step in achieving total nuclear disarmament .

9826
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:46,000
" Although the final draft of the treaty probably did n't totally satisfy any country , it was in general balanced , " the official People 's Daily newspaper said in a commentary .

9827
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:47,000
India blocked the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva , saying the pact did not contain a clause committing the five declared nuclear powers to a timetable for nuclear disarmament .

9828
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:48,000
New Delhi 's stance , which was seen as effectively thwarting 2-1/2 years of negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament , drew widespread but generally muted foreign criticism .

9829
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:49,000
India has also pledged to oppose any forwarding of the draft treaty to the United Nations General Assembly .

9830
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:50,000
China said many countries had compromised to complete the treaty and that the issue of a disarmament schedule could be discussed in future negotiations .

9831
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:51,000
" The completion of the test ban treaty would be an important and practical step in the gradual process of achieving total nuclear disarmament , " it said .

9832
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:52,000
China has pledged support for the pact since reaching a deal with the United States that made international inspections of nuclear sites more difficult than in earlier drafts of the accord .

9833
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:53,000
The newspaper said China advocated the complete ban and destruction of nuclear weapons but that there was little hope other nuclear powers would soon adopt the same stance .

9834
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:54,000
" Some nuclear powers stubbornly uphold policies of nuclear deterrence based on first use of nuclear weapons , " it said .

9835
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:55,000
China held on July 29 what it said would be its last nuclear test before a self-imposed moratorium that took effect the following day .

9836
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:56,000
China was the last declared nuclear power to announce a halt to testing .

TOKYO 1996-08-27

9839
02:43:58,000 --> 02:43:59,000
The government said on Tuesday that the threat from a mysterious killer germ , while still requiring vigilance , appears to be receding in the western Japan city of Sakai , where the epidemic hit the hardest .

9840
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:00,000
The food poisoning epidemic caused by the O-157 colon bacillus in Sakai appears to be " settling down " , Health Minister Naoto Kan was quoted by a government spokesman as telling the cabinet .

9841
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:01,000
The O-157 colon bacillus has been found responsible for a widespread food poisoning epidemic that has killed 11 people and made over 9,500 ill this year .

9842
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Sakai , near the regional commercial centre of Osaka , has been hit hardest by the deadly bacteria , with nearly 6,500 , mostly schoolchildren , affected by the disease .

9843
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Two children in Sakai have died from complications associated with the bacteria .

9844
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Kan told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that no new victims have been reported since August 8 , indicating that the peak has passed , at least for Sakai .

9845
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:05,000
Sakai officials agreed with the assessment , but said it was too early to feel relieved .

9846
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:06,000
" There are still patients hospitalised and problems which must be dealt with , " a city spokesman said , citing the issue of whether to allow children infected with the bacteria but not showing symptoms to attend school from September .

9847
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:07,000
Health authorities believe school lunches were the source of the food poisoning in Sakai , but researchers have been unable to pinpoint the exact source of the infection .

9848
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:08,000
The outbreak has prompted authorities to tighten sanitary standards at slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants and sparked calls for an overhaul of the nation 's school lunch programme .

9849
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:09,000
The ministers agreed at Tuesday 's cabinet meeting to step up inspection measures for school lunches in September and October , when schools around the country resume .

9850
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Japan 's Agriculture Ministry also announced that it will compile hygiene guidelines based on U.S. government methods of checking the safety of farm produce to prevent another outbreak of the epidemic .

9851
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:11,000
As of Monday , 31 children were still hospitalised in Sakai city , of whom six were in serious condition .

Japanese shipments of aluminium mill products in July surged 8.9 percent over the same month last year to 224,609 tonnes , while production rose 6.4 percent to 222,457 tonnes , according to preliminary data released on Tuesday by the Japan Aluminium Federation .

9855
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:15,000
The surge reflected strong demand from the beverage can and housing construction sectors , federation officials said .

9856
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Figures released two weeks ago from Japan 's seven largest mills already showed that Japan 's can sheet output reached its highest monthly level ever in July , reflecting above-average temperatures that sparked a jump in beer consumption .

9857
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,000
A federation official added that the half-year through September 1996 also appeared likely to set a new record for can production , despite cooler temperatures in August .

9858
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:18,000
July inventories stood at 75,632 tonnes , down 2.6 percent from the prior month .

June mill output data were revised slightly downward to 210,622 tonnes from the preliminary 210,683 , while shipments were revised marginally upward to 213,989 tonnes from 213,845 .

9861
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:21,000

China has publicly thanked Gabon for its strong support at the United Nations Human Rights Commission , where Beijing has come under attack from Western nations for its human rights record .

9868

China 's President Jiang Zemin offered his gratitude in a meeting on Monday with visiting Gabon President Omar Bongo , the official Xinhua news agency said .

9869
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Jiang also acknowledged the Central African nation 's support for China 's stance on Taiwan , which Beijing views as a renegade province , while Bongo was quoted as thanking China for economic and technological aid , the agency said late on Monday .

9870
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:30,000
In April , China quashed a draft resolution by the U.N. Human Rights Commission expressing concern over continuing reports of Beijing 's violations of fundamental freedoms .

9871
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:31,000
After the defeat of the resolution , drafted by the European Union and the United States , China 's Foreign Ministry thanked 26 countries for backing its motion for " no action " on the document .

9872
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:32,000
It was the sixth year in a row that China avoided censure at the U.N. 's main human rights forum .

9873
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:33,000
China has been accused of a wide range of human rights abuses , often in violation of its own legal code , in an effort to silence dissent .

9878
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:38,000
The bank said in a statement it was cutting its prime lending rate to 7.35 percent from 7.40 percent .

It also would cut its three-month-to-three-year time deposit rates by between 0.05 and 0.10 percentage points .

9880
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:40,000

9881
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:41,000
In the central bank 's latest bid to jumpstart Taiwan 's sluggish economy , Sheu ordered a reduction of up to a half-percentage point in banks ' reserve requirements and called on commercial banks to pass on the savings in the form of interest rate reductions .

9885
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Palestinian leaders in Jerusalem called on Tuesday for a two-hour strike to protest what they called Israel 's war on Arab East Jerusalem after police demolished a building there .

9886
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:46,000
Israeli police demolished a 10 metre ( yard ) by 20 metre structure in Jerusalem 's Old City they said had been built with funding from the Palestinian self-rule Authority for use as a social club .

9887
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Police used a huge crane to lift a bulldozer over the Old City 's walls to reach the building amidst narrow alleys , witnesses said .

9888
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Bystanders at the scene said work had begun on the building in 1991 and it had yet to be completed when the Israeli police bulldozed it .

9889
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:49,000

" There has been a call for a general strike between one ( 1000 GMT ) and three o'clock , " Palestinian lawmaker Ahmed Hashem Zighayer told Reuters .

9891
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:51,000
" This is a war that has been declared on us and we want our people to come and see the site where they declared the war . "

9892
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:52,000
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's government , which took office in June , has said it will not allow the Authority , set up under a 1993 interim peace deal to control parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank , to operate in Jerusalem .

9893
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Israel 's previous government held the same position but in general turned a blind eye to Palestinian Authority activity in the city .

9894
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:54,000
Tuesday 's demolition came a day after PLO officials said they had bowed to Netanyahu 's demand they close offices in Jerusalem .

9895
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:55,000
They said two of the three offices Israel wanted closed had been shut .

9896
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Netanyahu has made closure of the three offices a condition for resuming peace negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) .

Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock .

9908
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:08,000
In a limit order , investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell , as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices .

9909
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:09,000
" These rules are intended to empower all investors , by allowing their orders to compete on a level playing field , and by providing the disclosure they need to make informed decisions , " said SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt .

9910
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:10,000
The SEC 's goal , he added , was to create " one system where one price could be available to everybody . "

9911
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:11,000
The director of the SEC 's division of market regulation , Richard Lindsey , said Wall Street firms will probably need to spend about $ 7 million to carry out the improvements called for by the new rules .

9912
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:12,000
In proposing the rules last year , the SEC noted that while technology has improved , commonplace practices still existed that worked against investors ' best interests .

9913
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:13,000
It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market .

9914
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:14,000
It also cited the potential problem of a two-tiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems , thus robbing investors without access to " hidden " quotes the benefit of the best available prices .

9915
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:15,000
Earlier this month , the SEC settled charges of alleged malpractices on Nasdaq when the parent of the Nasdaq market , the National Association of Securities Dealers , agreed to spend $ 100 million over five years to upgrade its oversight of brokers ' trading practices .

9916
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:16,000
The SEC dropped a third proposal that would have allowed investors with market orders to trade at a better price if there were shifts in prices before their orders were executed .

9917
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:17,000
The agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the " price improvement " proposal again .

9918
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:18,000
The agency also proposed rule changes that would require continuous " bid " and " ask " quotations from exchange specialists and market makers who trade more than 1 percent of a stock during any quarter on Nasdaq .

9919
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:19,000
The SEC 's limit order display rule will mean a major change for Nasdaq , where such orders have never been displayed .

9920
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:20,000
The president of the Nasdaq , Alfred Berkeley , was to hold a news conference Wednesday afternoon to elaborate on the new rules ' effects on the market , the second largest in the world .

9921

ITALIAN CABINET APPROVES TELEVISION DECREE .

9922
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:22,000
ROME 1996-08-28

9923
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:23,000
The Italian cabinet on Wednesday granted a reprieve for media mogul Silvio Berlusconi 's Mediaset television empire with a decree extending the current legal framework for television stations until January 31 , 1997 .

9924
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:24,000
The decree plugs a legal void in which magistrates could have forced the former prime minister to take one of the three stations he controls off the air because of a court ruling that no single proprietor should be allowed to keep three channels .

9925
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:25,000
Passengers injured in train collision in Linz .

9926
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:26,000
LINZ , Austria 1996-08-28

9927
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:27,000
A passenger train collided with a locomotive at a main railway station in Linz on Wednesday and police said around 10 people were injured .

9928
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:28,000
Austrian television reported earlier that more than 20 had been hurt in the accident at the station in Linz , 300 km ( 180 miles ) west of Vienna .

9929
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:29,000
" One locomotive was stationary and the passenger train collided into the back of it , " a police spokesman in Linz told Reuters by telephone .

9930
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:30,000
The express passenger train travelling from Steyr , southeast of Linz , with around 80 people on board , hit the back of a service locomotive used to shunt wagons into sidings .

9931
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:31,000
The police spokesman said he was not sure whether any more passengers were still trapped in the wreckage .

9932
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Doctors and medical staff from a hospital across the road from the station were at the scene of the accident within minutes and were able to treat the injured quickly , he added .

9933
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:33,000
Greater damage was averted as the driver of the passenger train had time to apply his emergency brakes before the collision occurred , a state railways spokesman told Austrian news agency APA .

Saskatchewan Wheat Pool eyes hog market .

9935
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:35,000
WINNIPEG 1996-08-28

9936
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:36,000
Canada 's largest grain handling firm said Wednesday it expects to forge a partnership with hog farmers by 1997 with a view to expanding the company 's scope into pork production .

9937
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:37,000
" Saskatchewan is well positioned to take advantage of growing world markets for pork , " Saskatchewan Wheat Pool chief executive Don Loewen said in a company statement .

9938
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:38,000
SWP said it was analyzing potential partnerships with hog farmers and expected the first deal to be in place in 1997 .

9939
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:39,000
The end of Canada 's rail freight subsidy last year caused a shift in feed grain production to the eastern Prairie .

9940
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Analysts said livestock production would likely shift to the eastern Prairie rather than feed grains being shipped to the western Prairie .

9941
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:41,000
SWP said it may develop pork production systems that provide farmers with large integrated units , and it may consider contracting programs between producers and packers which would operate within the existing hog market framework .

9942
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Saskatchewan Pork International Marketing Group has an export monopoly but some Saskatchewan farmers earlier this month called for an open market in hogs .

MANCHESTER , England 1996-08-28

10142
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:02,000
Britain 's Chris Boardman fulfilled his prediction that he would break the world 4,000 metres world record in the world track cycling championships on Wednesday .

10143
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:03,000
Boardman clocked four minutes 13.353 seconds to slice more than six seconds from the previous world mark of 4:19.699 set by Olympic champion Andrea Collinelli of Italy in Atlanta in July .

10144
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Collinelli qualified in second place , also beating his old record in 4:17.696 .

10145
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:05,000
" I was very nervous before the start but then I was amazed by the speed of my ride , " Boardman said . "

10146
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:06,000
I do n't know if I can go any faster .

10147

Who knows what will happen in the later stages ? "

10148
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:08,000
Boardman , 28 , did not contest the Olympic pursuit because of its proximity to the Tour de France in which he led the French GAN team .

10149
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:09,000
However , he took a bronze medal in the Olympic road time-trial and then returned home to prepare for the world track series in the Manchester indoor velodrome .

10150
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:10,000
He adopted the " superman " riding position with arms at full stretch perfected by fellow Briton Graeme Obree , the 1995 world champion , and taken up in Atlanta by Collinelli .

10151
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:11,000
Obree was forced to pull out of his title defence because of a viral infection .

10214
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:14,000
To go another five weeks without that chance would have been foolish , " he added .

I 'm only 34 .

10231
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:31,000
Some say that 's too old for an athlete , " he said .

10232
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:32,000
" But I 'll be 38 by Sydney and that 's not too old .

10233
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:33,000
It 's whether I have got the enthusiasm for the training over the next four years .

NEW YORK 1996-08-28

10350
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Second seed and co-world number one Monica Seles advanced to the third round of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships without hitting a ball on Wednesday .

10351
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Seles , the 1991 and 1992 champion who dropped just one game in her opening match , was scheduled to play Laurence Courtois of Belgium Wednesay night .

10352
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:32,000
But tournament officials announced about four-and-a-half hours before the match that Courtois had pulled out due to a left knee bone inflammation , moving Seles into the next round on a walkover .

10353

TENNIS - SERIOUS MEDVEDEV IS HAVING FUN AGAIN .

10354

Richard Finn

10355
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:35,000
NEW YORK 1996-08-28

10356
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:36,000
Outspoken Andrei Medvedev exchanged his reputation as the clown prince of tennis on Wednesday for a new no-nonsense attitude that has made life on the courts fun again .

10357
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:37,000
" I think I 'm much more focused on what I have to do , and that 's playing tennis , " Medvedev said after routing Frenchman Jean-Philippe Fleurian 6-2 6-0 6-1 in the opening round of the U.S. Open .

10358
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:38,000
It was Medvedev 's sixth victory in a row after winning his first tournament of the year last week at the Hamlet Cup .

10359
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:39,000
" I realised this year , that without putting 99.9 percent of your mind into tennis , I do n't think you can successful , " said the 22-year-old Medvedev .

10360
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:40,000
" The whole day I 'm thinking abnout tennis .

10361
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:41,000
I felt that all the other things I was doing the years before , they were distracting me , they were not helping me at all . "

10362
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:42,000
For Medvedev that meant confining his post-match comments to tennis and not going off on tirades about about peripheral issues such as the poor quality of food in the players lounge , an entertaining rant that took his mind off the task at hand .

10363
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:43,000
" I know what I 'm here for , " said Medvedev , who lost in the second round of the Open the last two years after reaching the quarters in 1993 , the same year he tried his hand as a restaurant critic .

10364
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:44,000
" I 'm not here to fight the press or talk about the food or entertain the people off the court .

10365
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:45,000
I 'm here to play tennis and to win .

10366
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:46,000
I have much less fun off the court .

10367
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:47,000
I have much more fun on the court , " he said .

10368
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:48,000
Just three years ago Medvedev was one of the world 's best , with a ranking of six after reaching the French Open semifinal and winning three tournaments .

10369
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:49,000
But Medvedev 's ranking slowly began to drop last year as he struggled with a wrist injury .

10370
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:50,000
The Ukrainian finally hit a low of 44th two months ago .

10371
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:51,000
" It 's somewhere where I would n't like to stay very long , " Medvedev said of his current ranking of 36 . "

10372
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:52,000
It 's a part of the penalty that I have to accept . "

10373
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:53,000
As part of his new businesslike approach , Medvedev hired Australian coach Bob Brett at the start of this year and the partnership is beginning to pay off .

10374
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:54,000
" At the beginning of the year we started from zero , " said Medvedev . "

10375
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:55,000
Winning in Long Island ( last week ) was like winning for the first time . "

10376
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:56,000
While Medvedev 's 77-minute romp past Fleurian was rather ordinary , the fact that the two were playing each other was rather remarkable .

10377
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:57,000
In the original draw , Medvedev and Fleurian were slotted to play each other .

10378
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:58,000
When controversy forced the draw to be done over -- against odds of 151-to-1 -- Medvedev and Fleurian drew each other a second time .

10379
02:52:58,000 --> 02:52:59,000
" When I saw the new draw I did n't have to change my preparation , " Medvedev said . "

10380
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:00,000
I think it 's destined that it turned out for me . "

TENNIS - GRAF WORKS HARD FOR FIRST-ROUND WIN .

10506
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:06,000
NEW YORK 1996-08-27

10507
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:07,000
It was n't supposed to be this hard for defending champion Steffi Graf to win her opening match at the U.S. Open on Tuesday night .

10508
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:08,000
But the script that called for the usual first-round demolition by the top-ranked top seed was rewritten by 29th-ranked Indonesian Yayuk Basuki playing with nothing to lose abandon .

10509
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:09,000
Graf , of course , prevailed 6-3 7-6 , but not before some tense moments that even had the German superstar thinking the match was going three sets .

10510
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:10,000
" I won the second set , which I did n't think I would do , being down 5-2 and the chances she had at 6-5 , " Graf recalled .

10511
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:11,000
Several of the other women 's seeds eased into the second round with more typical Graf-like efficiency Tuesday .

10512
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:12,000
As afternoon turned to evening , fourth-seeded Spaniard Conchita Martinez took apart Romanian Ruxandra Dragomir in 58 minutes with the loss of just two games , one more than second seed Monica Seles , who opened the second-day programme by crushing American Anne Miller 6-0 6-1 .

10513
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:13,000
Third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario , the 1994 champion , and eighth-seeded Olympic gold medalist Lindsay Davenport dropped three game each en route to the second round .

10514
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:14,000
But the day was not without its seeded casualties on the women 's side .

10515
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:15,000
Fifth-seed Iva Majoli of Croatia was picked off by Austrian Judith Wiesner and Wimbledon semifinalist Kimiko Date of Japan , the 10th seed , fell 6-2 7-5 to 53rd-ranked American Kimberly Po .

10516
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:16,000
Date 's defeat left no other seeded players in Seles 's quarter of the draw , which lost Anke Huber ( 6 ) and Maggie Maleeva ( 12 ) on Monday .

10517
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:17,000
But Graf , winner of 20 Grand Slam titles , was not about to join that list .

10518
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:18,000
" At some points I felt a little nervous , " she admitted . "

10519
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:19,000
When it came down to the important points , I felt more confident . "

10520
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:20,000
Basuki , a first-round loser here for the fifth consecutive year , was clearly going for winners , hitting the lines and running Graf around the court as she broke the top seed twice in the second set to grab that shocking 5-2 lead .

10521
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:21,000
Graf ran off the next three games to restore some semblance of order .

10522
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:22,000
But Basuki , her long black ponytail flying as she raced for shots , held her serve and twice had set point on Graf 's serve at 6-5 before the German unleashed a forehand pass to force the tie-break .

10523
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:23,000
" I lost the moment , " lamented Basuki , who has reached the fourth round at Wimbledon four times and was a semifinalist in Montreal earlier this month .

10524
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:24,000
Still , the feisty Indonesian got off to a 3-0 lead in the tie-breaker before a pair of costly double faults gave Graf her chance to avoid a third set .

10525
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:25,000
" Usually in the first one or two matches , you want to find your rhythm and want to get into it , " said Graf , who won seven of the last eight points in the breaker .

10526
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:26,000
" To be in that situation today , a couple of times having to play well , get down and play point-by-point , definitely is a good start . "

10527
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:27,000
BASEBALL - SOSA HAS SURGERY , OUT UP TO SIX WEEKS .

10528
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:28,000
CHICAGO 1996-08-27

10529
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:29,000
Chicago Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa underwent surgery on Monday to remove a fractured bone from his right hand and will miss four to six weeks , the club announced Tuesday .

10530
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:30,000
Sosa , a leading candidate for National League Most Valuable Player honours , was injured August 20th when he was hit by a Mark Hutton pitch in the first inning of an 8-1 victory over the Florida Marlins .

10531
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:31,000
The 27-year-old Sosa leads the league with 40 homers and is tied for 10th with 100 RBI .

10532
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:32,000
The loss of Sosa , who appeared in all 124 games this season , is a huge blow to the Cubs ' playoff hopes .

10533
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:33,000
SOCCER - MARCELO HAT-TRICK KEEPS PSV AT TOP OF DUTCH LEAGUE .

10534
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:34,000
AMSTERDAM 1996-08-28

10535
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:35,000
Brazilian striker Marcelo scored a hat-trick as PSV Eindhoven maintained their 100 percent record and stayed on top of the Dutch first division with a 3-1 win at Volendam on Wednesday .

10536
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:36,000
PSV 's main rivals for the title , defending champions Ajax Amsterdam , celebrated the novelty of having the roof of their new 51,000 seat stadium closed against the rain , with a 1-0 win over AZ Alkmaar .

10537
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:37,000
Ajax were missing six first-team players but Frank de Boer shot home the winner from a 20-metre free kick in the 30th minute of a dull game .

10538
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:38,000
Marcelo , signed in close season to replace compatriot Ronaldo who left to play for Barcelona , opened the PSV scoring in the 19th minute when he fired home after good work from Rene Eijkelkamp .

10539
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:39,000
The Brazilian found the mark again two minutes after halftime and again in the 56th minute before midfielder Pascal Jongsma scored a consolation goal for Volendam five minutes from time .

10540
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:40,000
Feyenoord Rotterdam suffered an early shock when they went 1-0 down after four minutes against de Graafschap Doetinchem .

10541
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:41,000
The equaliser came in the 73rd minute when Swedish international Henke Larsson scored from close range and 10 minutes later Jean-Paul van Gastel gave Feyenoord a 2-1 victory from the penalty spot .

10542
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:42,000
After three matches PSV lead the first division with nine points , three points clear of fifth-placed Ajax .

10543
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:43,000
SOCCER - ROBSON WINS FIRST TROPHY WITH BARCELONA .

10544
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:44,000
MADRID 1996-08-28

10545
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:45,000
Former England manager Bobby Robson enjoyed his first success in charge of Barcelona as his team weathered 90 minutes of non-stop Atletico Madrid pressure to win the Spanish Super Cup 6-5 on aggregate on Wednesday .

10546
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:46,000
Barcelona had won the first leg 5-2 but the second leg was a different story .

10547
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:47,000
Atletico came within a whisker of taking the Cup on the away-goal rule but squandered several chances after going 3-1 ahead 15 minutes from the end .

10548
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:48,000
Juan Lopez gave Atletico the lead midway through the first half after Barcelona fullback Albert Ferrer and substitute goalkeeper Julen Lopetegui failed to clear a Milinko Pantic cross .

10549
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:49,000
Barcelona 's Hristo Stoichkov made his only significant contribution of the evening 10 minutes after halftime when Sergi Barjuan broke down the right to set up the fiery Bulgarian with a simple equaliser .

10550
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:50,000
But Atletico struck back almost immediately through new signing Juan Eduardo Esnaider and then Serbian set-piece specialist Pantic made it 3-1 with a superb free-kick in the 75th minute .

10551
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:51,000
Robson praised Atletico after the game , which was played in the Community of Madrid athletic stadium because of pitch problems at the Vicente Calderon ground .

10552
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:52,000
The venue of Atletico 's first league game , scheduled for Sunday , is still in doubt with the Real Madrid 's Santiago Bernabeu a distinct possibility .

10568
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:08,000
The 24-year-old Gabrich , who signed for an undisclosed fee from the Argentine side Newell Old Boys , is set to join Dutch international Patrick Kluivert in the Ajax forward line .

10569
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:09,000
He is Ajax 's sixth new signing this year , joining midfielder Richard Witschge , defenders John Veldman and Mariano Juan and strikers Tijjani Babangida and Dani .

10570
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:10,000

ROME 1996-08-28

10572
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:12,000
UEFA Cup hopefuls Parma and Roma , under new coaches this season , crashed out of the Italian Cup to second division opponents on Wednesday while league champions Milan could only draw 1-1 at humble Empoli .

10573
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:13,000
Wealthy Parma , now coached by the former Italian international Carlo Ancelotti , were without new striker Enrico Chiesa and went down 3-1 at serie B club Pescara in their second round clash .

10574
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:14,000
Pescara 's Ottavio Palladini shattered Parma with goals in the second and fourth minutes .

10575
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Midfielder Marco Giampaolo made it 3-0 in the 38th minute and Parma 's Alessandro Melli pulled back a late goal six minutes from time .

10576
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:16,000
The second round was the entry point for the bulk of the serie A sides with the winners going through .

10577
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:17,000
The later stages of the cup are played over two legs .

10578
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:18,000
Parma 's defeat was a repeat of last season 's fiasco when they lost their opening cup match 3-0 to Palermo .

10579
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:19,000
Roma , now coached by Argentine Carlos Bianchi and watched by Italian national coach Arrigo Sacchi , lost 3-1 to Cesena -- another repeat of last season when the Rome club also went out at the first hurdle .

10580
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:20,000
Udinese , with Germany 's Euro ' 96 hero Oliver Bierhoff in their lineup , completed the hat-trick of beaten serie A sides when they went under 2-1 to newly relegated Cremonese .

10581
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:21,000
Milan 's new Uruguayan coach Oscar Tabarez avoided the nightmare of defeat but faces a replay at home next Sunday .

10582
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:22,000
Cup holders Fiorentina easily beat Cosenza 3-1 while European Cup holders Juventus also cruised through with a 2-0 win at small southern club Fidelis Andria .

10583
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:23,000
Two other serie A sides lost at the weekend -- Piacenza and last year 's losing finalists Atalanta .

10584
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:24,000
Two cup matches could not be played on Wednesday due to argument over first round results .

10585
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:25,000
Lecce 's 3-0 weekend defeat of Genoa was expected to be overturned by a sporting judge on Thursday after the home club fielded an ineligible player .

10586
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:26,000
That would set Genoa up for a second round match against local rivals Sampdoria .

10587
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:27,000
Nocerina 's 4-3 defeat of Piacenza was also subject to a complaint , later removed , that forced their second round match against serie A newcomers Perugia to be delayed .

10588
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:28,000
SOCCER - BAYERN HIT FOUR TO TAKE BUNDESLIGA TOP SPOT .

Goals from Thomas Helmer and Juergen Klinsmann helped Bayern Munich to a 4-2 home win over Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday and powered them to the top of the Bundesliga .

10591
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:31,000
The comfortable victory gave Bayern 10 points from their first four games , a point ahead of second-placed Stuttgart , who have a game in hand .

10592
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:32,000
Brazilian midfielder Paulo Sergio put Leverkusen ahead in the 25th minute but Alexander Zickler equalised just a minute later .

10593
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:33,000
A header from Helmer and an acrobatic strike from Klinsmann gave Bayern a two-goal cushion at halftime .

10594
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:34,000
But the pick of the 13-times champions ' goals came from Ruggiero Rizzitelli , who beat three defenders to put Bayern 4-1 up .

10595
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:35,000
Markus Feldhoff hit a consolation goal for Leverkusen .

10596
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:36,000
Hansa Rostock brought Cologne 's 100 percent record to an end with a 2-0 win over the Rhineside club while a Sean Dundee hat-trick inside seven minutes stood out in Karlsruhe 's 4-0 demolition of St Pauli .

10647
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:27,000
PARIS 1996-08-28

10648
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:28,000
Euro 96 star Vladimir Smicer of the Czech Republic scored at the last second for Lens , allowing them to retain the lead in the French soccer league on Wednesday .

10649
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:29,000
Smicer pushed the ball home in injury time to lead his team to a 3-2 victory over Montpellier , who were leading 2-1 until Cameroon 's Marc-Vivien Foe equalised on a header in the 85th minute .

10650
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:30,000
The win was the fourth in as many matches this season for Lens , who lead the table on 12 points .

10651
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:31,000
In-form Paris St Germain , who dismissed Nantes 1-0 , are second with 10 points .

10652
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:32,000
Along with Smicer , Robert Pires was the star of the night in France , scoring the first hat-trick of the league season in Metz 's 3-1 home victory over neighbouring Strasbourg .

10653
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:33,000
Pires , one of the most promising strikers in the country , was called up for the first time this week by French manager Aime Jacquet for a friendly against Mexico on Saturday at the Parc des Princes .

10654
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:34,000
Pires scored first with a powerful shot in the 35th minute before striking again from close range just before the break .

10655
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:35,000
A solitary raid allowed him to score his third in the 74th .

10656
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:36,000
Smicer 's goal was as hard-won as his team 's victory .

10657
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:37,000
Spurred by Foe 's leveller five minutes before , Lens pressed hard and Foe hit the crossbar in the dying seconds on another header .

10658
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:38,000
The ball bounced back to Smicer 's feet and he scored .

10659
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:39,000
Montpellier seized an unexpected lead thanks to Kader Ferhaoui in the fourth minute after a blunder from Lens goalkeeper Jean-Claude Nadon .

10660
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:40,000
The side from northern France , forced to fight an uphill battle from then on , pulled level thanks to Tony Vairelles in the eighth minute but young striker Fabien Lefevre made it two for Montpellier five minutes later .

10661
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:41,000
League favourites PSG scored a convincing 1-0 win over Nantes and confirmed they would again be the team to beat this season .

10662
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:42,000
Ironically , PSG 's victory owed a lot to two former Nantes players , striker Patrice Loko , who scored on a brilliant shot in the 33rd minute , and defender Benoit Cauet , who started the one-two which allowed Loko to score .

10663
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:43,000
The Parisians , who have yet to concede a goal , were without Brazil 's Leonardo and Panama 's Julio Cesar Dely Valdes , both called up by their national sides .

10664
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:44,000
For Nantes , who shocked PSG to win the league crown two years ago , the fall is very painful .

10665
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:45,000
The Canaries , who lost most of their key players within two years , have yet to win a match this season .

10666
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:46,000
Reigning champions Auxerre had to settle for a goalless draw against Marseille on Tuesday .

10806
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:06,000
Organisers hope to persuade Britain 's former Olympic 100 metres champion Linford Christie to join a " Dream Team " sprint relay in a special tribute to Jesse Owens at Friday 's Berlin grand prix .

10807
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:07,000
Christie , who is retiring from international competition at the end of the season , was not due to compete in the German capital but Berlin promoter Rudi Thiel said : " We are still hopeful of getting him to come . "

10808
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:08,000
Thiel has managed to get most of the Olympic 100 metres champions since 1948 to attend the meeting , which is being held in the stadium where Owens won four gold medals 60 years ago at the Berlin Olympics .

10809
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:09,000
Canada 's Donovan Bailey , the Olympic 100 metres champion and world record holder , and Namibian Frankie Fredericks , the silver medallist at the recent Atlanta Games , have already agreed to run in the 4X100 metres team .

10810
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:10,000
Thiel said on Wednesday that he had also asked Olympic 200 and 400 champion Michael Johnson to run as well as Christie .

10811
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:11,000
" Most of the Olympic champions of the past are coming including Britain 's ( 1980 champion ) Allan Wells .

10812
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:12,000
Christie belongs to them .

10813
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:13,000
It would be great to have him here .

10814
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:14,000
" There is a good offer ....

10815
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:15,000
My minimum would be that he just ran the relay , " he said .

10816
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:16,000
The 36-year-old Briton is still considering the offer and is expected to announce his decision later on Wednesday .

10817
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:17,000
Owens 's widow Ruth is not well enough to attend but a message from her will be read out during the meeting and one of the sprinter 's relatives is expected to attend .

10818
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:18,000
The relay race , which will include squads from Africa , the United States and Europe as well as the Owens ' quartet , will be held at the end of the meeting .

10819
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:19,000
Organisers had hoped to include 1984 and 1988 champion Carl Lewis in the squad but he injured himself in Brussels last Friday .

COLOMBO 1996-08-28

10822
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:22,000
Sachin Tendulkar marked his debut as Indian captain with a patient 110 on Wednesday , but was upstaged by dashing Sri Lankan opener Sanath Jayasuriya whose 120 steered the world champions to a nine-wicket Singer Cup win .

10823
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:23,000
Sri Lanka , playing in front of their home crowd for the first time since winning the World Cup last March , comfortably passed India 's modest 226-5 from 50 overs in 44.2 overs .

10824
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:24,000
The devastating opening pair of Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana shared a fine first wicket stand of 129 to the delight of the 25,000 fans .

10825
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:25,000
Jayasuriya , whose first 50 included three sixes and three fours , went on to an unbeaten 120 and the man-of-the-match award .

10826
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:26,000
Kaluwitharana , slow in comparison , was bowled by Tendulkar for 53 , but Aravinda de Silva with 49 not out helped see Sri Lanka home .

10827
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:27,000
Earlier , Tendulkar completed his ninth century in one-day cricket , taking 138 balls to do it before being run out .

10828
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:28,000
The rest of the Indian batting was generally tied down by brilliant fielding and some fairly tight bowling , although ex-captain Mohamed Azharuddin chipped in with 58 , adding 129 with Tendulkar off 28 overs , before being stumped .

10829
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:29,000
The next match in the four-nation tournament is on Friday when Sri Lanka play Australia in a repeat of the World Cup final in Lahore where Sri Lanka won by seven wickets .

- Princeton Lyman , the U.S. Under-Secretary of State for International Organisations , will on Wednesday continue his work in Angola visiting Bailundo , where he should be received by Jonas Savimbi , leader of Unita .

10881
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:21,000
On Tuesday Lyman participated in a meeting of a joint-commission where he considered that the Angolan politicians should advance faster and find a way to cooperate .

10882
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:22,000
In his opinion the quartering of Unita forces must be concluded in all the Angolan territory and the troops must be selected and integrated in the armed forces , the government forces must be concentrated in the principal units and the free circulation of people and goods must be reality in all the country .

CAPE TOWN 1996-08-28

10885
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:25,000
South Africa 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission said on Wednesday it would subpoena persons accused of human rights violations to appear before it .

10886
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:26,000
" We can subpoena anyone we want to , even the president of the country , " spokesman John Allen told Reuters . "

10887
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:27,000
Subpoenas are due to be served on a number of people this week . "

10888
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:28,000
Media reports have speculated that the commission , which is trying to heal the wounds of apartheid by confronting the past , could subpoena apartheid-era President P.W. Botha and former police generals Basie Smit and Johan Van Der Merwe .

10889
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:29,000
In submissions last week to the commission National Party leader and former president F.W. De Klerk said he had received no co-operation from Botha in compiling his party 's report .

10890
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:30,000
Since it began work in April the commission has been hearing harrowing tales from the victims of apartheid-era abuses , by both the white minority regime and its opponents .

10891
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:31,000
It also wants to hear from those who committed the abuses , to whom it can offer amnesty in return for frankness .

10892
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:32,000
Hopes that reformed perpetrators would come forward voluntarily have faded but the commission has the legal power to force them to appear .

10893
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:33,000
Allen declined to give say who would be subpoenaed .

10894
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:34,000
" At the moment we have a preliminary list of less than 10 people , but this is just the beginning , " he said .

10895
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:35,000
The commission was set up last year to probe 30 years of human-rights violations during the apartheid era .

10896
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:36,000
It is chaired by Nobel Peace winner , retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu .

10897
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:37,000
Allen said the commission could announce the names of subpoenaed persons on Monday next week .

03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:41,000
" The plane landed at Sofia airport at 1503 ( 1203 GMT ) after receiving a signal that there is an explosive on board , " the official , who declined to be named told Reuters .

10902
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:42,000
The plane , surrounded by 11 fire-engines , is being checked for explosives at the moment .

10903
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:43,000
Nothing has been found so far , added the official .

10904
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:44,000
In March a Turkish Cypriot airliner hijacked while on a flight from northern Cyprus to Istanbul landed in Sofia airport to refuel before landing in Munich , where the hijacker was arrested .

FORT WORTH , Texas 1996-08-28

10907
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:47,000
Arch Petroleum Inc said Wednesday an exploratory well in Alberta 's Morinville area tested in excess of 1,100 barrels daily and will begin production immediately .

10908
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:48,000
The company said the 90 percent owned Trax et al Morinville 10-23 logged 28 feet of productive Leduc Reef at 5,350 feet .

10909
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:49,000
Reserve estimates from this well are at 250,000 gross barrels of oil .

10910
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:50,000
The Trax well is one of the prospects developed by Arch through its early 1996 purchase of Trax Petroleums Ltd , the company said .

10911
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:51,000
It said another , the Cometra et al Morinville 11-13 , has logged 128 feet of productive Leduc Reef at 5,400 feet and is flowing water free at the rate of 590 barrels of oil per day on a 15 / 64ths-inch choke .

10912
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:52,000
Arch owns a 16 percent working interest in this well with most of the rest held by the privately owned operator .

10913
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:53,000
Arch said full production has begun and initial estimates of gross reserves attributable to this well range up to one million barrels of oil .

10914
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:54,000
A third well drilled in this area , the Trax et al Morinville 2-25 , encountered the Leduc Reef but tested wet .

10915
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:55,000
At the company 's Nordegg prospect , the Apache et al Saunders 14-28 , has reached total depth in the Leduc Reef at approximately 3,800 feet and has been abandoned , Arch said .

10916
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:56,000
It said this acreage earning well brought an interest in an additional 5,120 acres , building the company 's gross land position in this area to 8,320 acres .

10917
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:57,000
At the Butte prospect , the Garrington 4-8 has reached total depth of 11,500 and has logged 278 feet of Leduc Reef .

10918
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:58,000
Testing has begun and results will be announced within the next several days , Arch said .

10919
03:01:58,000 --> 03:01:59,000
Including the costs of the two abandoned wells , the company said , these first prospects have added to reserves at a finding cost of about U.S. $ 2 per barrel of oil equivalent .

10924
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:04,000
In order to help him decide whether he should hear the case , a U.S. District Court judge Wednesday ordered the legal counsels of Biogen Inc and Berlex Laboratories , a subsidiary of Schering AG , deposed .

10925
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:05,000
The tempest beyond the test tube involves allegations that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration violated the Orphan Drug law by allowing Biogen the right to sell its multiple sclerosis drug Avonex .

10926
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:06,000
Berlex also charges that Avonex is so similar to its MS drug , Betaseron , that it is a patent infringement .

10927
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:07,000
Both drugs are types of interferon .

10928
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:08,000
One analyst said sales of Avonex had already cut into Betaseron market share .

10929
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:09,000
BioVest Research , Inc 's analyst Eddie Hedaya said , " Berlex sales are losing share like mad ...

10930
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:10,000
my understanding of the marketplace is that they 're below expectations . "

10931
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:11,000
He added Chiron Corp reported its sales of inventory to Berlex was down .

10932
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:12,000
Chiron makes Betaseron ; Berlex markets it , he said .

10933
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:13,000
Biogen , in its Securities and Exchange Commission quarterly report for the period ending June 30 , said it had earned $ 6.1 million from Avonex sales during the drugs first six weeks on the market .

10934
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:14,000
When it approved Avonex in May , the FDA said both Biogen 's product and Betaseron were developed under the incentives of the Ophran Drug Act which provides seven years of marketing exclusivity for products that treat rare diseases .

10935
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:15,000
Avonex " has been allowed to enter the market because it differs from interferon beta-1b ( Betaseron ) ..

Now , U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf has ordered the chief counsel for Biogen , Michael Astrue , and Robert Chabora , his counterpart at Berlex be deposed about a May 21 meeting the two men attended to help him determine whether the lawsuit filed by Biogen against Berlex should be heard in Massachusetts .

10939
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:19,000
Berlex filed a lawsuit against Biogen in U.S. District Court in Newark , N.J. in July , but Biogen had already filed a suit against Berlex in Massachusetts in May .

10940
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:20,000
Wolf ordered the depositions to determine if he or U.S. District Judge John Bissell of Newark should preside over the case .

Deputy Minister for Finance Ousmane Kaba said teams of inspectors would check government offices in the capital and the provinces to root out civil servants who drew salaries but had left their jobs , were dead , or had never existed .

11118
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:18,000
Some 50 million Guinean francs ( $ 50,000 ) has been pumped into the exercise to deter the inspectors from taking bribes .

11131
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:31,000
Faction fighting and an orgy of looting in the capital Monrovia in April and May killed hundreds of people .

A Nigerian human rights group said on Wednesday that four members of a recently banned university union had been arrested .

11139
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:39,000
" The Constitutional Rights Project ( CRP ) believes that William Istafanus , Elisha Shamay , O.K. Likkason and Jerome Egurugbe were arrested because of their role in the ongoing ASUU ( Academic Staff Union of Universities ) strike , " the group said in a statement .

11140
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:40,000
The CRP said the four were arrested on Monday night at the northeastern Tafawa Balewa University .

11141
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:41,000
The main academic union , ASUU , along with two smaller university unions , was banned by Nigeria 's military government last week , because of a four-month strike by teachers for better working conditions .

BRATISLAVA 1996-08-28

11149
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:49,000
Marc Dutroux , the chief accused in a Belgian child murder and sex abuse scandal , is suspected of murdering a young Slovak woman , the Slovak office of Interpol said on Wednesday .

11150
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:50,000
Rudolf Gajdos , head of Slovak Interpol , told a news conference Dutroux was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one Slovak woman .

11151
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:51,000
" One of the police versions in the case of the murder of young gypsy woman in Topolcany , western Slovakia , this July , is a suspicion that Mark Dutroux could have been involved in the murder , " Gajdos said without elaborating on the age of the victim and on the other versions .

11152
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:52,000
Slovak police , Interpol , and Belgian police have been following leads on Dutroux 's activities in Slovakia and the neighbouring Czech Republic where he is known to have made frequent visits .

11153
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:53,000
Gajdos said the police sketch of the suspected murderer was " 60 percent identical with Dutroux 's portrait " , and that Dutroux was known to have been in Topolcany around the time of the woman 's murder .

11154
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:54,000
" Topolcany and the area around this town were reported to have been the most visited places by Dutroux and his accomplices in Slovakia , " Gajdos said .

11155
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:55,000
Dutroux , a convicted child rapist and unemployed father-of-three , led police 11 days ago to the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in the garden of another of the six houses he owns around the southern Belgian city of Charleroi .

11156
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:56,000
" The Belgian police also informed us that Dutroux , together with one other man , had ( also ) planned the kidnapping of at least one Slovak woman , " Gajdos said .

11157
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:57,000
" The plan apparently failed due to difficulties in crossing the border , " he added , but did not elaborate .

11158
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:58,000
The Slovak police are also investigating visits by about 10 Slovak women , aged 17 to 22 , to Belgium , at the invitation of Dutroux .

11159
03:05:58,000 --> 03:05:59,000
The women said they went to Belgium voluntarily and police suspect they were used to act in pornographic films , Gajdos said earlier this week .

11160
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:00,000
But he added they had difficulty remembering what happened during their visits to Belgium , perhaps because of drugs , and were unsure whether they were filmed for pornography .

A man knifed to death international model Agnieszka Kotlarska outside her home in Wroclaw , western Poland , Polish television said on Wednesday .

11165
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:05,000
The man , who said he had once been engaged to her , first knifed Kotlarska 's husband in the leg , then stabbed her three times in the chest when she tried to intervene during the incident on Tuesday .

11166
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:06,000
She died in hospital .

11167
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:07,000
Kotlarska , who was 24 and had a three-year-old child , was Miss Poland in 1991 and went on to a U.S.-based modelling career that included working with Italian designer Gianni Versace and Vogue magazine , the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper said .

11168
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:08,000
She had been due to fly on a TWA airliner which exploded near New York last month , but had cancelled her booking , the newspaper said .

11169

Her attacker , identified only as Jerzy L. , 36 , was arrested by police and will appear in court on Thursday morning , television reported .

Leading Russian shares edged down on Wednesday in thin volume in the absence of Western orders , traders said .

11174
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:14,000
The Russian Trading System index of 21 issues fell 1.64 percent to 180.38 on volume of $ 4.38 million .

11175
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:15,000
" The market was extremely quiet today , some profit-taking locally , no Western orders , " said Nick Mokhoff , director of sales and trade at Alliance-Menatep . "

11176
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:16,000
We are just a bit lower with a lot of inactivity during the whole day . "

11177
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:17,000
Alexander Babayan , managing director at CentrInvest Securities , said the volume of orders was four to five times lower than a week ago .

11178
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:18,000
As often , the most volume was in UES .

11179
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:19,000
" Unified is one of the blue chips , which has more prospects than anybody else does , because they have ADRs supposedly coming up , " Mokhoff said .

11180
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:20,000
UES officials said last week the board had not yet approved the final version of its application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to issue ADRs .

11181
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:21,000
UES fell to $ 0.0817 from $ 0.0822 at Tuesday 's close with 8.90 million shares changing hands .

Gazprom was the loser of the day with prices closing at $ 0.300 , down from $ 0.355 on Tuesday and $ 0.445 on Monday .

11183
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:23,000
Mokhoff said uncertainty about when Gazprom would issue ADRs and about whether shares from the Russian market could be converted into ADRs had hurt prices .

11184
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:24,000
" Western investors ... will be investing in ADRs and I do not think people in Russia will be able to come up with the money for the underlying shares to drive the Russian shares to those levels , " Mokhoff said .

11185
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:25,000
Gazprom has also tightened the rules restricting shareholers ' rights to trade its shares .

11186

11191
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:31,000
The Albanian daily Koha Jone reported earlier that Greece had deported about 5,000 Albanians in the last five days .

" The Foreign Ministry is trying to find out from the Greek embassy why Albanian refugees have been deported from Greece , " Shehu told Reuters .

Bulgaria has restored ownership rights to pre-communist private owners of 75 percent of the arable land or around four million hectares , an Agriculture Ministry official said on Wednesday .

11197
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:37,000
" So far 75 percent has been returned with the land restitution almost completed in some regions like Southeastern Bulgaria but lagging behind in other areas , predominantly in the mountains , " the official told a news conference .

11198
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:38,000
The ministry has said that it planned to return 96.6 percent of the arable land or 5.2 million hectares to its original owners by the end of this year .

11199
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:39,000
A land reform act passed four years ago abolished Soviet-style collective farms , allowing the return of 5.4 million hectares to original owners or their heirs .

German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , who spoke to President Boris Yeltsin by telephone on Wednesday , plans a trip to Moscow on September 7 and will visit Yeltsin at his vacation home near Moscow , Interfax news agency said .

11204
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:44,000
Interfax , quoting Yeltsin press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky , said Yeltsin and Kohl had discussed bilateral relations and international issues on the telephone .

11205
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:45,000
Yeltsin had told Kohl about efforts to find a political solution to the conflict in Russia 's breakaway Chechnya region , Interfax added .

11206
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:46,000
Yeltsin , who left on vacation on Monday , is staying at an exclusive private hunting lodge some 100 km ( 60 miles ) from Moscow .

11207
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:47,000

11211
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:51,000
Bosnian refugees in Hungary , the first to vote last weekend in their country 's first post-war election , found the rules confusing and some had no idea who they voted for , refugees and officials said on Wednesday .

11212
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:52,000
" For the most part they really did n't understand what was going on , " the director of the Nagyatad camp Lajos Horvath told Reuters on Wednesday .

11213
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:53,000
" It was confusing , they had no experience of voting , many of the refugees are only semi-literate and none of them knew anything about the candidates , " he said .

11214
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:54,000
" They just voted along ethnic lines where they could . "

11215
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:55,000
The Bosnian election is set for September 14 and voting began on Wednesday for most of the 600,000 Bosnians living abroad .

11216
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:56,000
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which is running the election , allowed the ballot to be held on Sunday in four Hungarian refugee camps .

11217
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:57,000
Some Moslem refugees among the 385 registered voters Hungary 's largest camp Nagyatad have written to the OSCE complaining that they were unable to vote in contests for the president or assembly of the Bosnian-Croat Federation , where most Moslems live .

11218
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:58,000
This was because their pre-war homes are now in the Serb-controlled territory , so they were voting for the national assembly of the Republika Srbska , most of the candidates for which are Serbs .

11219
03:06:58,000 --> 03:06:59,000
For the foreign powers which back last year 's Dayton peace agreement , the main point of the election rules is that by voting as though they were still in their pre-war homes , Bosnians should override the effects of ethnic cleansing and reassert the concept of a single multi-ethnic state .

11220
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:00,000
But Adem Hodzic , one of the refugees who signed the letter of complaint , told Reuters :

11221
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:01,000
" We only realised after voting that we were being denied the rights of other Bosnian Moslems to choose our president .

11222
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:02,000
This vote seals the division of my country . "

11223
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:03,000
Under the election rules citizens vote for a three-man presidency and House of Representatives for all Bosnia-Hercegovina and for assemblies and cantonal seats in either the Moslem-Croat Federation or the Republika Srbska .

11224
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:04,000
On Sunday voters in Hungary also cast ballots for municipal councils but these will be invalidated following the cancellation of local elections by the OSCE on Tuesday .

11225
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:05,000
Husein Micijevic , who also signed the letter , alleged that elderly voters were directed who to vote for by Hungarian translators who stood in the polling booth to help them .

11226
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:06,000
" Probably 100 refugees were shown where to put their cross , " he said .

11227
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:07,000
Seventy eight-year-old Mandolina Zelic , a Bosnian Croat who has spent the last five years in Nagyatad , told Reuters she had cast her ballot because she 'd been told to by the camp authorities but had no idea who she voted for .

11228
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:08,000
" At first the organisers would n't let anyone help me but when they saw I did n't understand a young translator ringed the names I had to mark , " she said . "

11229
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:09,000
I do n't know who I voted for . "

11230
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:10,000
Maria Szabo of the Hungarian office organising the elections on behalf of the OSCE told Reuters on Wednesday her office was studying the letter but said they had followed OSCE instructions very carefully .

11231
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:11,000
" The envelopes , each with the five different voting slips , were sealed until voting and had written instructions on how to vote , " she said . "

11236
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:16,000
This comes after three votes in the 101-strong parliament on Monday and Tuesday failed to give either incumbent Lennart Meri or rival candidate Arnold Ruutel the necessary 68 votes for a clear mandate .

11237
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:17,000
The outcome was a rebuff for Meri , failing three times to win backing in his bid for a second term as head of state of the former Soviet republic .

11239

Both Meri , 67 , and Ruutel , 68 will automatically be listed as candidates but the election will also be open to new nominations with the backing of any 21 members of the college .

11240
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:20,000
The winner has to secure a majority from the college within two rounds of voting otherwise the election will go back before the parliament .

03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:23,000
Russian security chief Aleksander Lebed faces an almost impossible task in Chechnya and is likely to be sidelined , Polish Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati was reported as saying on Wednesday .

11244
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:24,000
According to best-selling daily Gazeta Wyborcza , Rosati told the Polish parliament 's foreign affairs committee on Tuesday that the fact Lebed had been charged with resolving the conflict in Chechnya showed he would be marginalised .

11245
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:25,000
" It is almost impossible to gain success in this , " it quoted Rosati as saying during a committee debate .

11246
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:26,000
" Lebed has no diplomatic experience .

11247
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:27,000
Yeltsin sent him there to compromise him .

11248
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:28,000
This tactical manoeuvre also shows that in the ruling circle there is no unity of action , " he said .

11249
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:29,000
Lebed , who has arranged a military truce with separatist rebels in the southern Russia region , was in Moscow this week seeking support for a deal on Chechnya 's political status .

11250
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:30,000
But Russian President Boris Yeltsin has seemed unwilling to meet his envoy and went on holiday on Monday .

11251
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:31,000
Gazeta Wyborcza quoted Rosati as saying Yeltsin was very ill and effectively on leave , but for now retained control in Russia although matters were passing into the hands of his close collaborators .

11252
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:32,000
Rosati said Russia 's July polls , in which Yeltsin won re-election , showed democracy had passed an important test and the Russian people had chosed the path of further reforms .

11253
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:33,000
But he said a power struggle in Russia 's ruling circles could not be ruled out , which could harm further reforms .

11254
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:34,000
He expressed concern over problems in the Russian economy , saying this could lead to social unrest , the daily reported .

11255
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:35,000
On Moscow 's foreign policy , Rosati said it had changed its stance on NATO 's eastward expansion and was preparing itself for Poland 's inevitable entry into the Western alliance .

11256
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:36,000
He also reportedly criticised Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov , saying his style of work resembled that of the Soviet-era 1970s and 1980s .

Romania 's state budget deficit jumped sharply in June to 1,242.9 billion lei for the January-June period from 596.5 billion lei in January-May , official data showed on Wednesday .

11260
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:40,000
Six-month expenditures stood at 9.50 trillion lei , up from 7.56 trillion lei at end-May , with education and health spending accounting for 31.6 percent of state expenses and economic subsidies and support taking some 26 percent .

January-June revenues went up to 8.26 trillion lei from 6.96 trillion lei in the first five months this year .

11262
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:42,000
Romania 's government is expected to revise the 1996 budget on Wednesday to bring it into line with higher inflation , new wage and pension indexations and costs of energy imports that have pushed up the state deficit .

11263
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:43,000
Under the revised version state spending is expected to rise by some 566 billion lei .

11264

No new deficit forecast has been issued so far .

11265
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:45,000
In July the government gave a 6.0-percent wage and pension indexation to cover energy , fuel and bread price increases , which quickened inflation to 7.5 percent last month .

11266
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:46,000
In the original state budget , approved in March , revenues were envisaged at around 16.98 trillion lei and expenditures 20.17 trillion lei for 1996 .

The Costa Rican government said on Wednesday that a Dutch couple abducted over the weekend from a tree farm in northern Costa Rica was kidnapped by former Nicaraguan guerrillas .

11273
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:53,000
" Even though it 's an act of common delinquency , the case could take a difficult turn because former Nicaraguan guerrillas are involved , " Security Minister Bernardo Arce told reporters .

11274
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:54,000
Earlier this year , a German tourist and a Swiss tour guide were kidnapped from the same general area in northern Costa Rica near the Nicaraguan border .

11275
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:55,000
They were held for 71 days before relatives paid a ransom to free them .

11276
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:56,000
Two Nicaraguan former guerrillas have been arrested in the case .

11277
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:57,000
Because of the apparent threat to foreigners in Costa Rica near the Nicaraguan border , Arce said the government has advised many to take additional security measures on their own .

11278
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:58,000
Hurte Sierd Zylstra and his wife , Jetsi Hendrika Coers , both 50 years old , were seized late on Saturday or early on Sunday from a teak tree plantation they manage by at least two heavily armed men who took the two off in their own car , leaving behind a ransom note demanding $ 1.5 million .

11279

03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:02,000
A top judicial official and critic of President Ernesto Samper accused the government of indifference on Wednesday over efforts to lift Colombia 's five-year-old ban on extradition .

11283
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:03,000
" It would seem that the subject of extradition is unworthy of an opinion from the government , " Deputy Prosecutor-General Adolfo Salamanca said .

11284
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:04,000
Constitutional reforms were proposed on Tuesday by two senators , one of them a member of Samper 's own Liberal Party , aimed at lifting the ban on extradition introduced in 1991 .

11285
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:05,000
U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette applauded the move , saying it could prompt the Clinton administration to remove Colombia from a list of outcast nations that have failed to cooperate in U.S. counternarcotics efforts .

11286
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:06,000
Samper -- who weathered a year-old crisis stemming from charges he financed his 1994 election campaign with drug money -- appeared less than enthusiastic , however .

11287
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:07,000
" Extradition is not on the government 's legislative agenda , " he told reporters on Tuesday .

11288
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:08,000
He added that he did not oppose the idea of opening a public debate over the issue .

11289
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:09,000
But he fell far short of endorsing the idea of putting Colombian drug lords onto U.S.-bound flights to serve stiff penalities in American prisons .

11290
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:10,000
Salamanca , who spoke at a meeting on kidnapping in Colombia , has said in the past that there was ample evidence to prove that Samper 's campaign received millions of dollars in contributions from the country 's top drug lords .

11294
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:14,000
The quake struck at 11.16 a.m. ( 1716 GMT ) and was centred 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of the port of Quepos , which is 90 miles ( 140 km ) south of the capital San Jose , the Costa Rican Volcanic and Seismologicial Observatory said .

11295
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:15,000
The quake was felt for about seven seconds in most of the country but preliminary reports said no one was hurt , it added .

11296
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:16,000
The quake took place a few minutes before the end of a welcoming ceremony at Juan Santamaria airport for Hashimoto , who was starting a three-hour visit as part of a Latin American tour .

11297
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:17,000
Hashimoto , who arrived at 11 a.m. ( 1700 GMT ) , showed no sign of having felt the quake , witnesses said .

11301
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:21,000
Officials said the Senate vote removed all existing legislative hurdles in the way of CVRD 's sell-off .

11302
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:22,000
The motion was put forward by Sen .

11303

Jose Eduardo Dutra , who had drawn up the bill .

11304
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:24,000
The Senate vote also annulled a substitute version of Dutra 's bill which had sought to dedicate revenue from Vale 's privatization to regional infrastructure projects .

RAMALLAH , West Bank 1996-08-28

11333
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:53,000
The Palestinian Legislative Council on Wednesday called for a halt to contacts with Israel , just hours after President Yasser Arafat said the Jewish state had effectively declared war on the Palestinians by pursuing its hardline policies .

11334
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:54,000
A resolution released by the council called for " halting contacts with the Israeli side and leaving the mechanism to carry out this to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat " .

11335
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:55,000
The council was meeting in Ramallah to discuss Israel 's new policy of Jewish settlement expansion and its uncompromising line on Jerusalem since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June .

Council resolutions are not necessarily binding .

11337
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:57,000
Arafat had earlier blasted Israel saying its policies amounted to a declaration of war against the Palestinian people .

11338
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:58,000
He also called for the first general strike in two years in the West Bank and Gaza on Thursday .

11339
03:08:58,000 --> 03:08:59,000
" What happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new Israeli leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the Palestinian people , " Arafat told the council .

11340
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:00,000
Council speaker Ahmed Korei said the decision was part of a comprehensive plan to confront Israeli settlement policy , land confiscation and what he termed other violations of the Israeli-PLO peace deals .

11343
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:03,000
An Iraqi Kurdish group on Wednesday said it had agreed a new U.S.-brokered ceasefire with a rival faction after a previous accord was shattered by sporadic fighting between the groups in recent days .

11344
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:04,000
" The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) leadership declares its endorsement for a ceasefire arrangement with the KDP ( Kurdistan Democratic Party ) to take effect as of 8:00 a.m. on August 28 , " the PUK said in a statement .

11345
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:05,000
The PUK said the ceasefire was agreed after talks between U.S. Assistant Secretary for Near East Affairs Robert Pelletreau and PUK leader Jalal Talabani .

11346
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:06,000
The KDP , led by Massoud Barzani , had said a previous ceasefire negotiated by Pelletreau last Friday was broken by the PUK .

11347
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:07,000
Talabani has agreed to take part in talks in London on reaching a comprehensive settlement for the PUK-KDP conflict , the PUK statement said .

11348
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:08,000
It said the KDP was responsible for breaking the previous ceasefire by refusing to endorse it publicly .

An Iraqi Kurdish group on Wednesday said Iraq was massing troops near Kurdish regions in the north , where a U.S.-led allied air force protects the local population against attacks from Baghdad .

11352
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:12,000
" The Iraqi regime has started threatening the Kurdish population by massing troops in preparation to attack Kurdish towns and population centres , " the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) said in a statement .

11353
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:13,000
The PUK said it had received confirmed reports that Iraqi troops , supported by tanks , artillery and armoured vehicles , have already penetrated some Kurdish areas .

11354
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:14,000
It said the military presence reflects cooperation between President Saddam Hussein and the PUK 's rival , the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) .

11355
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:15,000
The PUK statement follows KDP assertions that the PUK is receiving military support from Iran .

11356
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:16,000
Hostilities between the two warring Iraqi Kurdish factions have continued in the last few days despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire last Friday .

11357

03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:22,000
Iraq on Wednesday said the hijackers of a Sudanese airliner were not Iraqi diplomats and added that " noble Iraqis " would never contemplate such an action .

11363
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:23,000
The official Iraqi News Agency ( INA ) quoted Iraq 's ambassador in Khartoum as saying that Iraq 's embassy in the Sudanese capital had nothing to do with the Monday night hijacking .

11364
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:24,000
Iraq 's ambassador in Khartoum denounced the hijacking and described it as a terrorist act which had nothing to do " with the morals and values of noble Iraqis , " INA said .

11365
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:25,000
Ambassador Abdulsamad Hameed Ali told INA there was only one diplomat among the 199 passengers and crew on the Sudan Airways Airbus .

11366
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:26,000
" He was not involved ...

11367
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:27,000
on the contrary he was harassed by the elements which carried out the hijacking , " he said .

11368
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:28,000
INA did not say the hijackers were Iraqis .

11369
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:29,000
The hijack started when the flight left Khartoum for Amman on Monday night .

11370
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:30,000
The hijackers told the crew they had grenades and other explosives and threatened to blow up the plane if they were not taken to London .

11371
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:31,000
The airliner refuelled at Larnaca , Cyprus and landed at London 's Stansted airport in the early hours of Tuesday .

11377
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:37,000
Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole Wednesday accused the Clinton administration of ignoring drug use among teenagers and said if elected he would use the National Guard to stop drugs from entering the United States .

11378
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:38,000
" He 'll probably mention his war on drugs , which he 's going to start like everything else -- next year .

11379
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:39,000
It 's too late , Mr. President , " Dole told an outdoor crowd of several hundred at a private religious school .

11380
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:40,000
He also commented briefly on published reports that the administration was planning to announce a plan to lower capital gains taxes for home sales . "

11381
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:41,000
Welcome to the club .

11382
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:42,000
We 've had it out there for weeks and weeks and weeks , " Dole said .

11383
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:43,000
Dole said former first lady Nancy Reagan was laughed at with her " just say no " anti-drug message . "

11384
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:44,000
But it worked , " Dole said .

11385
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:45,000
Meanwhile , in Los Angeles , Dole 's running mate , Jack Kemp , campaigned aggressively for the black vote in an area that was the flashpoint of the 1992 Los Angeles riots .

11386
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:46,000
Kemp told a crowd of about 300 African Americans in south central Los Angeles , " Keep your eyes open , keep your ears open , keep your heart open .

11387
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:47,000
I want to tell you with all my heart that we want to win your vote . "

11388
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:48,000
In Dole 's address to a group that was largely white , the presidential nominee likened the stream of illegal drugs into the United States to missiles aimed at American children and promised to appoint federal judges who would be tough on illegal drug use .

11389
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:49,000
" They 're aiming millions and millions of missiles right at these young people , whether it 's a needle , whether it 's a cigarette , whatever the delivery system is -- it 's poison and it 's got to stop in America . "

11390
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:50,000
he said .

11391
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:51,000
Dole said 70 percent of the cocaine that entered the United States and 40 percent of the marijuana came from Mexico . "

11392
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:52,000
We 've got an international problem and I 'm prepared to use our military might .

11393
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:53,000
We want to stop drugs at the border , " he said .

11394
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:54,000
Dole 's remarks prompted questions about whether he was seeking a ban on cigarettes . "

11395
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:55,000
I did n't say anything about cigarettes .

11396
03:09:55,000 --> 03:09:56,000
I was talking about drugs .

11397
03:09:56,000 --> 03:09:57,000
I said you should n't smoke either .

11398
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:58,000
That 's all I said , " he replied as he was shaking hands with well-wishers .

11399
03:09:58,000 --> 03:09:59,000
When asked specifically if he was suggesting a ban on cigarettes , Dole replied : " Oh no .

11400
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:00,000
Come on , you know better than that . "

11401
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:01,000
Dole campaign aides said the candidate was telling young people not to smoke .

11402
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:02,000
Dole also said he opposed California Proposition 215 which , if approved by voters , would allow the cultivation of marijuana plants for medicinal uses .

11403
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:03,000
Dole said the initiative would allow marijuana to be used for anything from a headache to an ingrown toenail .

11404
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:04,000
In an effort to paint the drug issue in non-political terms , Dole said three times during his 20-minute address that illegal drug use was neither a Democratic nor a Republican issue but one that involves all people .

11405
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:05,000
The anti-drug message is a theme Dole feels has strong voter appeal .

11406
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:06,000
On Sunday near Chicago he accused President Bill Clinton of " raising the white flag " in the war on drugs .

11407
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:07,000
A recent survey showed that illegal drug use among 12-17 year-olds had doubled in the past four years .

11408

Dole was flanked by several California Republican politicians including Gov .

11410

" We need all the help we can get .

11411

Profit taking continued to weigh on CME lumber futures but prices ended only slightly lower as strong cash markets underpinned futures , traders said .

11443

The same pattern of the past few days persisted with futures declining early on the profit taking before firming late .

Above-normal summer rainfall in the U.S. High Plains has produced near-ideal conditions for planting the 1997 hard red winter wheat crop , analysts said Wednesday .

11456
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:56,000
From central Texas north to Kansas , rains throughout July and August have relieved most of the drought conditions that plagued the region earlier this year .

11457
03:10:56,000 --> 03:10:57,000
" Our moisture situation is excellent , especially for fall planting of winter wheat , " said Kim Anderson , extension wheat marketing economist at Oklahoma State University .

11458
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:58,000
The irony of the above-average summer rainfall was not lost on High Plains wheat producers , who only three months ago were caught in a drought so severe that old-timers likened conditions to the " Dust Bowl " days of the 1930s .

11459
03:10:58,000 --> 03:10:59,000
" It 's definitely a turnabout from this past year , but you know last year we had pretty good moisture about this time of year , and then about October 1 it quit , " said Mark Hodges , executive director of the Oklahoma Wheat Commission . "

11460
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:00,000
Hopefully that 's not going to happen this year . "

11461
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:01,000
According to figures released by the Oklahoma Climatological Survey , an average of 20.19 inches fell across the state between March 1 and August 26 , 1996 .

11462
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:02,000
That 's about 1/2 inch above the average for the same time period , according to Howard Johnson , associate state climatologist at the University of Oklahoma .

11463
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:03,000
He noted that the majority of that 20.19 inches had fallen since July .

11464
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:04,000
As an example of just how dry it was , data showed that between October 1 , 1995 and March 1 , 1996 , the state received an average of only 4.6 inches of rainfall .

11465
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:05,000
In northern Texas , the current rainfall situation was similar to most of Oklahoma , said Rodney Mosier , executive assistant for the Texas Wheat Producers .

11466
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:06,000
" Up here in the Texas Panhandle , we 've had some extremely beneficial rains that came through within the last several days and are really setting us up for ideal conditions for planting wheat , " Mosier said .

11467
03:11:06,000 --> 03:11:07,000
But he warned that the situation was not as ideal in central and southern Texas , where mositure levels were still short despite the rains brought by Hurricane Dolly last week .

11468

In Kansas , typically the number one U.S. hard red winter wheat producer , topsoil moisture levels were rated mostly adequate during the week ended Sunday , according to the state 's agricultural statistics service .

11469
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:09,000
In its weekly report released Monday , the service said Kansas topsoil moisture was rated eight percent surplus , 77 percent adequate and 15 percent short to very short .

11470
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:10,000
Oklahoma 's Agricultural Statistics Service showed similar conditions , rating topsoil moisture levels as seven percent surplus , 81 percent adequate and 12 percent short to very short .

11471

First Union National Bank of Florida said on Wednesday it agreed to settle a class action law suit involving its collateral protection insurance ( CPI ) program .

11476
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:16,000
To provide for the settlements , First Union has established a common fund of $ 4.7 million for cash refunds and $ 19.4 million in credit refunds for outstanding CPI balances .

11477
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:17,000
The bank is a division of First Union Corp .

11478
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:18,000
The bank said most of the charges resulted from loan portfolios from banks and thrifts that were acquired in the 1980s .

11479
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:19,000
First Union said it has discontinued CPI as an element of its motor vehicle or boat installment loan contracts .

11480
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:20,000
As part of the settlement agreement , customers who had CPI placed on loans from January 1 , 1986 to September 31 , 1996 , will receive cash or credit refunds , the bank said .

11481
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:21,000
Cash refunds will go to those who paid their loans to First Union while credit refunds will go to those who have existing loan balances , the bank said .

11485
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:25,000

Burundi 's ambassador on Wednesday lashed out at economic sanctions imposed by African states and said any thought of an arms embargo would be a windfall for guerrillas fighting his army-run government .

11497
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:37,000
In a lengthy debate on Burundi before the U.N. Security Council , Ambassador Nsanze Terence said the new military government took over to stabilise the country and wanted negotiations under former Tanzanian President Julius Nyrere .

11498
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:38,000
Nearly every African member who spoke , as well as most Security Council members , however , were unsympathetic towards the government of President Pierre Buyoya , an army major put in power in a July coup by the Tutsi-run military , which is locked in a guerrilla war with the majority Hutus .

11499
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:39,000
" These ( African ) brothers should have been the first to bind the wounds of Burundi , " Terence said of the economic embargo . "

11500
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:40,000
Quite the contrary , Burundi has seen economic war declared against it by fellow African people ... a gratuitous immolation of the people of Burundi . "

11501
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:41,000
He said his government had just asked U.N. human rights monitors to increase their numbers in Burundi in an effort " to put an end to this vicious circle of violence . "

11502
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:42,000
More than 150,000 people have been killed in violence between the minority Tutsis and the majority Hutus since 1993 .

Botswana 's envoy , Mothusi Nkgowe , said coups should be relegated " to the dump heap of history " as there could be no justification for the overthrow of a legitimate government .

Chile has proposed a resolution , still under discussion , that would impose an immediate arms embargo on Burundi and call for negotiations .

11505
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:45,000
The draft suggests further sanctions against those who impede a political solution .

11506
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:46,000
Among the council 's five permanent members , Russia and the United States appeared to support most elements of the Chilean proposal , while Britain , France and China were cautious .

11507
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:47,000
Terence , a Tutsi , said any arms embargo would leave the army unable to defend itself against Hutu guerrillas and leave the population exposed to " armed terroritsts . "

11508
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:48,000
But Chilean Ambassador Juan Somavia said : " Every weapon that reached Burundi is a weapon aimed mainly at killing an unarmed civilian .

11509
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:49,000
We must not send a signal different from the African leaders themselves .

11511
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:51,000
Burundi 's parliament has been suspended and political parties are banned but Terence told reporters Buyoya would reconvene a new type of national assembly in October .

11512
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:52,000
The United States said the coup leaders had taken no steps to restore democracy and indiscriminate killings continued .

11513
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:53,000
Ambassador Karl Inderfurth said the new government should have " unconditional " negotiations with all parties inside and outside of the country .

11514
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:54,000
He said Washington strongly supported the economic sanctions imposed already and if these did not work the council would consider " an arms embargo or targeted sanctions against faction leaders . "

11515
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:55,000
But he said the international community had to be prepared for the worst and avoid a replay of the horrors in neighbouring Rwanda , where widespread genocide broke out against the Tutsis two years ago .

11516

11559
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:39,000
About 8,000 protesters marched through Karachi on Wednesday demanding the removal of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , witnesses said .

11560
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:40,000
" From here we will march to Islamabad and by God we will not let Benazir and ( Bhutto 's husband Asif Ali ) Zardari escape justice , " Nawaz Sharif , leader of the main opposition Pakistan Muslim League told a rally organised by a 16-party alliance .

11561
03:12:40,000 --> 03:12:41,000
Sharif accused Bhutto of corruption and nepotism , charges she has denied in the past .

11562
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:42,000
Witnesses said protesters carrying colourful party flags walked for several miles , chanting anti-government slogans .

11563
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:43,000
The event was part of an opposition campaign launched on August 14 , Pakistan 's independence day .

11564
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:44,000
Sharif said similar rallies would be held in the Balochistan provincial capital Quetta and the Punjab provincial capital Lahore before an opposition march on the capital Islamabad .

11565
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:45,000
" I promise the people of Karachi that those responsible for the extra-judicial killing of innocent youths would not be spared , " Sharif said .

Karachi 's ethnic Mohajir National Movement ( MQM ) accuses the government of killing many of its militants in cold blood .

11567
03:12:46,000 --> 03:12:47,000
The government has denied the charge and blames the MQM for much of the violence that killed 2,000 people in the city last year .

11568
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:48,000
Political observers said the turn-out was disappointing for a city of about 12 million people , possibly indicating that the MQM , although a member of the opposition alliance , had not mobilised its supporters for the event .

11569
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:49,000
The turbulent southern port has been calmer this year , but police say more than 300 people have died in political unrest .

11570
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:50,000
The MQM speaks for Urdu-speaking Moslems who migrated from India at Partition in 1947 and their descendants .

11571
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:51,000
Sharif , a former prime minister , is the main political rival of Bhutto , who defeated him in the October 1993 election .

11572
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:52,000
He said only the removal of the government and an early election could save Pakistan from disaster . "

11573

We will dislodge the Bhutto government .

11578
03:12:57,000 --> 03:12:58,000
India 's leading cement firm Associated Cement Companies ( ACC ) said on Wednesday its cement sales rose to 3.1 million tonnes in April-July 1996 from 2.93 million a year ago .

11579
03:12:58,000 --> 03:12:59,000
ACC Chairman Nani Palkhivala told shareholders at the firm 's annual meeting cement output rose to 3.14 million tonnes in the first quarter of 1996/97 ( April-March ) , from 3.01 million a year ago .

11580
03:12:59,000 --> 03:13:00,000
Palkhivala said ACC had secured government approval to take over a sick cement firm with a grinding capacity of 275,000 tonnes per year . "

11581
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:01,000
We will take it over early next month , " he said .

11582
03:13:01,000 --> 03:13:02,000
Talking about the cement industry in general , Palkhivala said Indian production rose by about 10 percent in 1995/96 .

11583
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:03,000
" The industry saw capacity expansion of about 13 percent over 1994/95 from 77.79 million tonnes to 87.45 million tonnes , " Palkhivala told shareholders .

11584
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:04,000
He said Indian cement exports dropped about eight percent from the previous year because of stiff international competition and inadequate infrastructural facilities .

11585
03:13:04,000 --> 03:13:05,000
ACC 's own export performance was marginally better than in 1994/95 on account of a 36 percent rise in exports to Nepal and the opening of a new market - Sri Lanka , he said .

11586
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:06,000
Despite power shortages , ACC achieved a satisfactory growth in production during the year with the help of its power plants .

11587
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:07,000
ACC sold 9.4 million tonnes in 1995/96 , retaining its top position in the Indian cement industry , Palkhivala said .

11601
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:21,000
Indian fishermen said on Wednesday they had been forced at gunpoint to ferry refugees fleeing the ethnic war in Sri Lanka to India , as a protest strike by more than 30,000 fishermen entered its ninth day .

11602
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:22,000
" There is little we can do when at mid-sea .

11604
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:24,000
Some 850 refugees have landed in recent weeks at the port of Rameswaram in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu , home to 50 million Tamil-speaking people , port officials say .

11605
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:25,000
Rameswaram is 15 km ( 10 miles ) off the coast of Sri Lanka .

11606
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:26,000
State chief minister M. Karunanidhi has publicly welcomed the refugees , who are fleeing the 13-year war between Tamil separatists and government troops that Colombo says has cost 50,000 lives .

11607
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:27,000
But the influx has triggered fears of a repeat of the 1980s when some 200,000 refugees landed in Tamil Nadu .

11608
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:28,000
Intelligence officals said more than 5,000 Tamils were waiting on the western coast of Sri Lanka to cross into India .

The Indian government has warned its fishermen that their boats would be impounded if they were caught ferrying refugees .

11610
03:13:29,000 --> 03:13:30,000
The fishermen went on strike last week to protest the government 's cancellation of three trawlers ' fishing licenses after the boats were caught carrying Tamil refugees .

11611
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:31,000
All Fishermen 's Association secretary N.J. Bose said the strike would continue indefinitely and the fishermen would block road and rail traffic if their demands were not met .

11612
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:32,000
" Until the government releases our boats from naval custody and Sri Lankan naval custody , and gives us assurance ( it will not revoke licences of boats ferrying refugees ) , we will not call off our strike , " Bose said .

11613
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:33,000
LTTE spokesmen could not immediately be reached for comment , but Sri Lankan fishermen denied that Indians were being coerced into carrying refugees across the Palk Strait .

11614
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:34,000
" Indian fishermen come right up to Pesalai to fish , and when refugees request them to ferry them across , they readily oblige .

11616
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:36,000
Arulanandam denied the fishermen charged the refugees for passage to India and said it was unfair to penalise them for the refugees ' arrival .

11617
03:13:36,000 --> 03:13:37,000
" We have not gone to sea since August 19 , but refugees are arriving daily nevertheless .

Evert will depart for Alexandroupolis on Saturday afternoon .

11640

Prime Minister Costas Simitis criticized Evert today for unleashing a seven-point economic package that offers tax relief to merchants and other professionals , higher pensions to farmers and support for small business .

11641
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:01,000
The finance ministry estimated the cost of ND 's economic measures to over 600 billion drachmas but ND officials put the figure much lower to about 300 billion drachmas .

11642
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:02,000
Simitis blamed ND for the low absorption rate of EU funds and said the socialists will increase farmers ' pensions , combat tax evasion and accelerate GDP growth rates to 4.0 percent in a few years .

11643

Faster economic growth is a major component of ND 's economic programme and Evert has repeatedly blamed the socialists for the slow economic growth .

11649
03:14:08,000 --> 03:14:09,000
On the foreign exchange markets , a survey indicating weaker than expected Japanese business sentiment boosted the dollar in early trading but it failed to build on its gains against the yen and slipped lower against the mark in quiet afternoon trade .

03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:10,000
London shares , boosted by Wall Street , added to early gains with the blue chip FTSE 100 index hitting a new peak of 3921.8 before dropping back slightly .

11669

RAMALLAH , West Bank 1996-08-28

11690
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:50,000
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said on Wednesday that Israel had declared war on the Palestinians and called for the first general strike in the West Bank and Gaza in two years .

11691
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:51,000
" What happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new Israeli leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the Palestinian people , " Arafat told the Palestinian legislature .

11692
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:52,000
Accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of stupidity , Arafat launched his strongest attack on the right-wing government since its election in May .

11693
03:14:52,000 --> 03:14:53,000
The tirade was sparked by Israel 's announcement on Tuesday of plans to expand the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Sefer and its demolishing of a community centre in Arab East Jerusalem .

11694
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:54,000
" Israel has started the war on Jerusalem .

11695
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:55,000
They are idiots to have started the Jerusalem battle , " Arafat said in Arabic . "

11696
03:14:55,000 --> 03:14:56,000
There will be no Palestinian state without Jerusalem .

11697
03:14:56,000 --> 03:14:57,000
Netanyahu should know he is stupid to have started this battle . "

11698
03:14:57,000 --> 03:14:58,000
Arafat called for a general strike " for Jerusalem " on Thursday in all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip .

11699
03:14:58,000 --> 03:14:59,000
There has not been a joint shutdown there since May 1994 when Israeli troops began withdrawing under an interim self-rule agreement signed in 1993 .

11700
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:00,000
The strike will have little effect on the Israeli economy while hurting Palestinian merchants in East Jerusalem and Bethlehem who cater to the tourist trade .

11701
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:01,000
Some 25,000 Palestinian labourers are likely to stay away from their jobs , mainly in construction , in Israel .

11702
03:15:01,000 --> 03:15:02,000
But Palestinians , once the backbone of the building industry , have been largely replaced by labourers from Romania and China .

11703
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:03,000
" On Friday , all Moslems , including Palestinians in Israel ...

11704
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:04,000
will go to ( Jerusalem 's ) Al-Aqsa mosque and pray .

11705
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:05,000
Jews and Christians who do not pray should accompany them and stand behind them , " Arafat said .

11706
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:06,000
Officials in Netanyahu 's office were not immediately available for comment on Arafat 's remarks .

11707
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:07,000
Israeli travel restrictions , imposed after bombings by Moslem militants in February and March , ban most of the two million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza from entering Jerusalem .

11708
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:08,000
Netanyahu , who opposes trading occupied land for peace , made Jerusalem a central issue in his election campaign , accusing Labour Prime Minister Shimon Peres of planning to hand control of the Arab eastern part of the city to the Palestinians .

11709
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:09,000
Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and claims both halves of the city as its capital .

11710
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:10,000
The PLO wants East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state .

11711
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:11,000
In his speech to the crowded legislature , Arafat signalled he was not abandoning diplomacy although " alarm bells are ringing " .

11712
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:12,000
He unexpectedly broke off his address to take a telephone call from U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross , who held talks in Paris on Tuesday with Israeli and Egyptian officials .

11713
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:13,000
When Arafat returned to the podium , he said senior PLO negotiator Mahmoud Abbas , better known as Abu Mazen , and Netanyahu aide Dore Gold could meet on Thursday .

11714
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:14,000
He quoted Ross as telling him : " The important thing is the Israelis are prepared to move . "

11715
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:15,000
Arafat said he replied : " is this like their previous promises ? "

11716
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:16,000
" No , they have good intentions , " Arafat quoted Ross as saying .

11717
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:17,000
Palestinians have been pressing Israel to carry out a long-delayed partial troop pullout from the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron agreed by the previous Labour government .

11718
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:18,000
The Israeli government is studying redeployment plans submitted by Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai which are likely to demand a wider than agreed army presence in Hebron .

11722
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:22,000
" The two-day visit will take place at the invitation of Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti , " he told reporters .

11723
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:23,000
He said Turkey considered Jordan a suitable country with which to cooperate on Middle East matters .

11724
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:24,000
Bilateral relations and the Middle East peace process would be on the table during the visit , Akbel said .

11729
03:15:28,000 --> 03:15:29,000
" Both countries ' governments were formed recently .

11730
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:30,000
This visit will create a direct contact opportunity for the two parties to express their views , " spokesman Omer Akbel told a news briefing .

11731
03:15:30,000 --> 03:15:31,000
The Italian prime minister , in office since May 18 , will be the first Western leader to meet Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan since he came to power on June 28 .

11732
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:32,000

11774

NEW YORK 1996-08-27

11794
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:34,000
U.S. investors in troubled Lloyd 's of London were considering late on Tuesday whether to appeal a U.S. court decision in favour of Lloyd 's and pledged to continue pursuing other legal actions .

11795
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:35,000
A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday gave Lloyd 's a reprieve , throwing out an injunction that the insurance giant said could have led to its collapse .

11796
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:36,000
A lower court issued the injunction on Friday and ordered Lloyd 's to give investors , known as Names , more information before requiring them to decide whether to accept a settlement offer as part of a reorganisation plan .

11797
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:37,000
" My prediction is that the Names will appeal , " said Kenneth Chiate , a U.S. Name and a chief negotiator for the American Names Association .

11798
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:38,000
" At this point , it is a sufficiently important decision that I 'm confident that they will appeal , " he said . "

11799
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:39,000
But to say that they definitely will would be premature until we determine what the exact basis for the court 's ruling is . "

11800
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:40,000
Under the reorganisation plan , Lloyd 's plans to reinsure its massive liabilities into a new company called Equitas .

11801
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:41,000
The arrangement calls for investors to make additional payments to fund Equitas but also provides them with 3.2 billion stg in compensation to help reduce their prior outstanding liabilities .

11802
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:42,000
The Names had been scheduled to decide whether to accept or reject the offer by 1100 GMT Wednesday , but Lloyd 's chairman David Rowland said on Tuesday the offer would be extended .

11803
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:43,000
At least eight U.S. states have still some form of litigation pending , said John Head , spokesman for the Association of Lloyd 's State Chairmen , a group representing U.S. Names .

11804
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:44,000
" It goes without saying that we 're rather disappointed , " Head said of the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit , sitting in Baltimore .

11805
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:45,000
But , he said , " we still have hope that somebody is going to see our point of view in this . "

11806
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:46,000
The Colorado attorney general told Lloyd 's last week it was considering a new legal action against the British insurance market , based on allegations of consumer fraud .

11807
03:16:46,000 --> 03:16:47,000
" We have notified them of our concerns and asked them to give us a response , " said Colorado attorney general Gale Norton .

11808
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:48,000
Norton said she was concerned that the Lloyd 's agreement immunizes it from future litigation regarding Equitas and requires that all legal actions be heard outside of Colorado .

11809
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:49,000
In addition , she said she was concerned the plan may not offer investors enough protection from additional , future liabilities .

11810
03:16:49,000 --> 03:16:50,000
Meanwhile , an appeal of a lawsuit filed by some 600 Names in California is still pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , Chiate of the American Names Association said .

11811
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:51,000
That lawsuit , which seeks rescision and restitution , was dismissed in a U.S. district court .

11812
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:52,000

The individual Names , however , now must decide whether to accept Lloyd 's settlement offer or reject the offer and pursue litigation .

11814
03:16:53,000 --> 03:16:54,000
Chiate said he has advised Names that " they must make , individually , a risk benefit analysis . "

11815
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:55,000
Rejection involved forfeiting the compensation offer and risking the possibility of owing Lloyd 's two to three times more than Lloyd 's is now willing to accept , he said .

11816
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:56,000
But , in rejecting the offer , the Names would retain their rights to pursue litigation , he said .

German riot police made Nazi gestures at a private function earlier this month and may face dismissal for their actions , the Bavarian Interior Ministry said on Wednesday .

11820
03:16:59,000 --> 03:17:00,000
The ministry declined to detail gestures the Nuremberg-based policemen had made at the August 13 function but added seven had been suspended from duty pending an internal inquiry .

11821
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:01,000
A spokesman for public prosecutors in the southern city , where dictator Adolf Hitler held some of his most infamous Nazi party rallies in the 1930s , said there were no plans to prosecute the officers as the gestures had not been made in public .

A motorist threatened a fellow driver with a starting pistol as he overtook him illegally in the inside lane on a motorway near Berlin and was photographed in the act by the driver 's wife , prosecutors said on Wednesday .

11825
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:05,000
Prosecutors in the city of Potsdam said the 32-year-old man drew alongside the other car at about 110 kph ( 70 mph ) and aimed his pistol at the driver .

11826
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:06,000
But the driver 's wife kept her nerve , got out her camera and photographed him .

11827

BERLIN 1996-08-28

11830
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:10,000
Berlin prosecutors said on Wednesday they had filed charges against two German men for sexually abusing children in Thailand and distributing pornographic films and pictures of their degrading acts .

11831
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:11,000
The case is one of only a handful in which authorities have managed to track down suspects under a law which lets them pursue Germans who commit sex offences abroad .

11832
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:12,000
The pair , identified only as 43-year-old clerk Dieter U and businessman Thomas S , 33 , are alleged to have carried out acts of sexual indecency with children as young as 10 years old between 1994 and 1995 .

11833
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:13,000
Their videos included pictures of one of the accused tying up a Thai boy and performing acts of sadistic torture on him , prosecutors said in a statement .

11834
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:14,000
In another scene , a young girl performed oral sex with an unidentified adult man .

11835
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:15,000
The new law was introduced with much fanfare in 1993 .

11836
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:16,000
But prosecutors face huge difficulties in gathering evidence and bringing witnesses to testify in a German court , and only one person has so far been convicted under the law .

11837
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:17,000
Investigators are probing several other cases .

11838
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:18,000
The Berlin prosecutors said they had been alerted to the two men by customs officials who intercepted packages containing pornographic photographs and order forms .

ROME 1996-08-28

11863
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:43,000
Two Italian magazines published pictures on Wednesday of Daniel Ducruet , Princess Stephanie of Monaco 's husband and former bodyguard , cavorting naked with another woman by a poolside in France .

11864
03:17:43,000 --> 03:17:44,000
The magazines , Eva Tremila and its sister publication Gente , printed up to 26 pages of photos of the woman undressing Ducruet , the pair embracing on a sunbed and finally both naked .

11865
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:45,000
Eva Tremila said other even more explicit photos were taken but it did not print them .

11866
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:46,000
The magazines named the woman as Fili Houteman , a 26-year-old French singer and dancer in a Belgian cabaret club .

11867
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:47,000
The photographs , an Italian exclusive , raised eyebrows in the tiny principality , where Stephanie 's father Prince Rainier , had long disapproved of his daughter 's choice of husband .

11868
03:17:47,000 --> 03:17:48,000
Stephanie had two children with Ducruet before their marriage in July last year .

11869
03:17:48,000 --> 03:17:49,000
Stephanie , Caroline and Albert are the children of Rainier and former Hollywood screen goddess Grace Kelly , who was killed in a car crash in 1982 .

The magazines said the photographs were taken in Cap de Villefranche , some 15 km ( nine miles ) from Monte Carlo .

11872
03:17:51,000 --> 03:17:52,000
Gente said Ducruet , a keen racing driver , met Houteman during a race in Belgium and photographers had been on their trail ever since .

11873
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:53,000
The magazine said video cameras had also been used to film the couple and that a sound-track existed .

03:19:07,000 --> 03:19:08,000
Weiss said the Australian share market had been somewhat negative for much of 1996 and this had some effect on the company 's first half results .

11949
03:19:08,000 --> 03:19:09,000
" However , it certainly is a very pleasing result for the first six months , " he said .

11950
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:10,000
Weiss said most of the company 's half year earning stemmed from the sale of its 50 percent stake in Physicians Insurance Co of Ohio .

11951
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:11,000
He said the company decided to sell its U.S. investment in order to consolidate investments closer to its administrative base .

11952

GPG said its stakes in Tyndall Australia Ltd and Mid-East Minerals Ltd both contributed strongly to GPG 's first half earnings .

Gold miner Newcrest Mining Ltd said on Wednesday it posted a A$ 4.3 million profit after tax in the final quarter of the year to June 30 , 1996 .

11958
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:18,000
Newcrest said earnings from the Telfer and Boddington mines were lower than the previous year due to lower head grades at the mines , forcing gold production lower .

11959
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:19,000
Production costs also rose eight percent during the year to A$ 406 per ounce .

Australian police on Wednesday continued to hunt a gunman in dense bushland after he killed his wife and wounded three other people , warning the man is extremely dangerous and may take a hostage to escape .

11963
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:23,000
The shooting occured around 6.30 a.m. ( 2030 GMT ) on Tuesday at Glenwood , south of Maryborough , about 150 km ( 93 miles ) north of Brisbane on the Queensland state coast .

11965
03:19:24,000 --> 03:19:25,000
" It is one step short of an emergency situation , " a police spokesman said via telephone from a command post in the bush .

11966
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:26,000
" We have not had any sightings , but we suspect he is armed , possibly with a .22 rifle and / or a self-loading shotgun .

11967
03:19:26,000 --> 03:19:27,000
He is considered extremely dangerous , " he said .

11968
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:28,000
" It 's a possibility , not a probability , he may take a hostage , but we have measures in place if that is the case . "

All three wounded are in a satisfactory condition in hospital .

11971
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:31,000
Fox initially fled from the shooting in a car , but then abandoned the car and entered dense bushland .

11972
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:32,000
Fox is a skilled bushman who knows the area very well , police said .

11973
03:19:32,000 --> 03:19:33,000
About 60 police , helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft have maintained an overnight cordon around 15 sq km ( six sq miles ) of bush near Glenwood .

11974
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:34,000

03:19:46,000 --> 03:19:47,000
Dissident Khmer Rouge leader Ieng Sary confirmed on Wednesday that he had broken with Pol Pot and other hardliners of the guerrilla group and had formed a rival movement .

11988
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:48,000
Ieng Sary said in a written statement , the first since his split with Pol Pot earlier this month , that the new movement to be called the Democratic National United Movement ( DNUM ) would seek an end to civil war and work towards reconciliation with the Cambodian government .

11989
03:19:48,000 --> 03:19:49,000
" I would like to inform you about my decision to break away from Pol Pot , Ta Mok , Son Sen 's dictatorial group , " he said in a copy of the statement obtained by Reuters .

11990
03:19:49,000 --> 03:19:50,000
" We believe that our country will be reduced to nothing if the Khmer people continue to fight against each other indefinitely ....

11991
03:19:50,000 --> 03:19:51,000
For this reason we decided to break away from that dictatorial group and found a movement named ' Democratic National United Movement ' , " he said .

11992
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:52,000
Ieng Sary was sentenced to death in absentia for his role in the mass genocide in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge rule of terror between 1975-1979 when over a million people were executed or died of starvation , disease or overwork in mass labour camps .

11993
03:19:52,000 --> 03:19:53,000

12001

TOKYO 1996-08-28

12002
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:02,000
Japan 's Finance Minister Wataru Kubo told a news conference on Wednesday that he believes that the Bank of Japan 's ( BOJ ) interest rate policy which is geared towards ensuring economic growth has not changed after the release of the central bank 's " tankan " survey .

12003
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:03,000
The BOJ released the August tankan , its quarterly short-term corporate survey , in the morning and it showed business outlook had worsened .

12004
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:04,000
However , Kubo said it did not necessarily show a substantial worsening of the economy .

12005
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:05,000
" The question is what the BOJ is going to do with its interest rate policy .

12006
03:20:05,000 --> 03:20:06,000
The BOJ governor has made it clear that the BOJ 's policy is aimed at ensuring basis for economic recovery .

12007
03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:07,000
I believe this policy has not changed , " he said .

12008
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:08,000
Asked if a supplementary budget for 1996/97 was needed to support the economy , Kubo said the tankan results would not lead to any immediate decision on the need for an extra budget .

12009
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:09,000
" I do n't think we should immediately draw a conclusion that the economic recovery has come to a halt or that signs of a economic contraction have emerged , " Kubo said . "

12010
03:20:09,000 --> 03:20:10,000
The economy is not recovering smoothly or at a fast pace . "

12011
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:11,000
Kubo said he would make a decision on the need for a supplementary budget after an announcement in mid-September of Japan 's gross domestic product for the April-June quarter .

12012
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:12,000
" I would like to see how the economy moved in the first half of 1996 , " he said .

03:20:14,000 --> 03:20:15,000
China on Wednesday called on Japan to acknowledge its wartime past and put a stop to a tide of resurgent militarism to prevent similar atrocities in future .

12016
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:16,000
" Some Japanese are still unrepentant about the atrocities committed by the Japanese militarists during the war , " said a commentary in the official China Daily .

12017
03:20:16,000 --> 03:20:17,000
" If they are still undecided whether the war Japan launched was aggressive in nature , it will be difficult to tell whether they will do the same again , " the newspaper said .

12018
03:20:17,000 --> 03:20:18,000
China raised indignant protests after several Japanese cabinet ministers visited a shrine dedicated to their country 's war dead on August 15 , the 51st anniversary of Japan 's World War Two surrender .

12019
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:19,000
" Numerous Japanese politicians have tried to whitewash their country 's war atrocities in recent years , " the commentary said .

12020
03:20:19,000 --> 03:20:20,000
China estimates 35 million Chinese were killed or wounded by invading Japanese troops from 1931 to 1945 .

12021
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:21,000

12025
03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:25,000
The leader of a junior partner in Japan 's three-party ruling coalition plans to resign to quell a political rebellion , party officials said on Wednesday .

12026
03:20:25,000 --> 03:20:26,000
The officials said New Party Sakigake President Masayoshi Takemura , finance minister until the beginning of this year , promised his resignation in a meeting with the politician who set off the rebellion in the smallest coalition member .

12027
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:27,000
They said the date of Takemura 's resignation would be determined by party officials .

12028
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:28,000
The Sakigake row has caused jitters in its coalition partners , Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto 's Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , the biggest grouping , and the Social Democratic Party .

12029
03:20:28,000 --> 03:20:29,000
But analysts said the row was not expected to immediately destabilise the government as even if Sakigake splits apart it has so few seats a loss of support would not lead to a general election .

12030
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:30,000
The dispute pits Takemura , who founded Sakigake in 1993 as a reform-oriented LDP splinter group , against party official Yukio Hatoyama , who says he will leave Sakigake to form a reformist political group next month .

12031
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:31,000
Hatoyama , the 49-year-old grandson of a 1950s prime minister , on Tuesday quit as Sakigake secretary general and has publicly snubbed the 62-year-old Takemura , pointedly ruling his mentor out as a possible member of the new political force .

12032
03:20:31,000 --> 03:20:32,000
Marathon talks between the two former allies on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning failed to resolve the dispute over the role of Takemura , seen by Hatoyama backers as tainted by his senior role in the LDP-dominated coalition .

12033
03:20:32,000 --> 03:20:33,000
The presence of Takemura , whose role as finance minister in passing an unpopular plan to use taxpayer funds to wind up failed housing loan firms ruined his reputation as a reformer , has stalled Hatoyama 's efforts to attract to his new group defectors from the opposition camp , analysts said .

12034
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:34,000
Media reports say that at most 10 of 23 Sakigake members , joined by a handful of Social Democrats , will follow Hatoyama when he bolts -- far short of the 50 lawmakers needed to topple Hashimoto 's eight-month-old government .

12035
03:20:34,000 --> 03:20:35,000
Hashimoto -- who returns from a 10-day Latin American tour on Saturday -- must call polls by mid-1997 , and has repeatedly said he would not call an early general election .

12036
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:36,000
But many analysts and politicians believe he may dissolve parliament soon after it reconvenes in early October .

With 307 days to go before the British colony reverts to China , the Hong Kong media focused mainly on domestic issues concerning alleged pressure on a judge , cross straights relations and the democratic lobby 's relationship with Beijing .

The Beijing-funded WEN WEI PO said Taiwan 's government could not hope to stem the island 's economic and trade exchanges with China .

Iran has asked Germany to extradite its former president Abolhassan Banisadr for alleged hijacking , an Iranian embassy spokesman said on Wednesday .

12123
03:22:02,000 --> 03:22:03,000
Banisadr angered Tehran last week by accusing top Iranian leaders of ordering the assassination of Iranian Kurdish leaders in a Berlin restaurant in 1992 .

12124
03:22:03,000 --> 03:22:04,000
He made the allegations at the trial of an Iranian and four Lebanese accused of carrying out the attack .

12125
03:22:04,000 --> 03:22:05,000
An Iranian embassy spokesman said in response to an inquiry that Iran had formally requested Banisadr 's extradition for hijacking the military aircraft which he commandeered to flee Iran in July 1981 .

12126
03:22:05,000 --> 03:22:06,000

Danish cleaning group ISS on Wednesday said it had signed a letter of intent to sell its troubled U.S unit ISS Inc to Canadian firm Aaxis Limited .

12143
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:23,000
An ISS statement said that Aaxis , with year-end 1996 assets of US$ 10.9 million and equity of $ 10.5 million , would be listed on the Montreal stock exchange , but did not say when .

12144
03:22:23,000 --> 03:22:24,000
It said that under the sale agreement , full financial details of which were not revealed , ISS would acquire a 25 percent stake in Aaxis which would become an associated company within the ISS group trading under the ISS name and logo .

12145
03:22:24,000 --> 03:22:25,000
ISS Inc senior management would continue to run the business under the new owners , it said .

12146
03:22:25,000 --> 03:22:26,000
Danish analysts recently estimated ISS Inc 's sale value at up to $ 118 million .

12147
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:27,000
ISS said that the deal included ISS Inc operations in Mexico and the sale of ISS Inc interests in Brazil would be discussed .

12148
03:22:27,000 --> 03:22:28,000
On August 15 , ISS published first half 1996 results showing a two billion crown loss caused by falsified accounts in ISS Inc and said that charges and provisions earlier estimated at $ 100 million would have to be increased to $ 146 million .

12149
03:22:28,000 --> 03:22:29,000
It also wrote down all ISS Inc goodwill and Wednesday 's statement said that the Aaxis purchase would not necessitate further write down if the sale were completed according to the terms of the letter of intent .

12154
03:22:33,000 --> 03:22:34,000
Iraq has balked at the number of U.N. staff needed to implement the oil-for-food deal , blaming the United States for insisting on stringent monitoring .

12155
03:22:34,000 --> 03:22:35,000
In comments to reporters and a statement on Tuesday , Iraqi diplomats said the cost of the monitors and other staff , which Baghdad has to finance , surpasses funds allocated for electricity , water , sewers , education and agriculture .

12156
03:22:35,000 --> 03:22:36,000
At issue was a May 20 agreement allowing Iraq to sell $ 2 billion worth of oil to purchase badly needed food , medicine and other supplies to ease the impact of sanctions in force since its troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990 .

12157
03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:37,000
The Iraqi statement said the United States was " interfering and pressing to augment the number of international staff and this is not legal and not justified . "

12158
03:22:37,000 --> 03:22:38,000
Iraq 's deputy ambassador , Saeed Hasan , noted that the May 20 accord said that the number of personnel would be determined by the United Nations and that the government of Iraq would be consulted .

12159
03:22:38,000 --> 03:22:39,000
Saeed in his comments did not threaten to call off the deal and the U.N. officials said they expected it to go into force next month after Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali reports that arrangements are in place .

12160
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:40,000
The U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs ( DHA ) , which has to coordinate the distribution of food , medicine and other goods , increased the number of monitors earlier this month at the insistence of the United States .

12161
03:22:40,000 --> 03:22:41,000
According to U.N. officials and diplomats , Iraq would have about $ 1.13 billion to spend for food , medicine and other goods after monies for a reparations fund for Gulf War victims and costs for U.N. weapons inspections were deducted .

12162
03:22:41,000 --> 03:22:42,000
The cost of the U.N. staff overseeing the distribution of food and other supplies was estimated to cost $ 31 million .

12163
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:43,000
In addition another $ 12 million was anticipated to cover other expenses , such as oil experts and administrative costs .

12164
03:22:43,000 --> 03:22:44,000
For the distribution and supervision of humanitarian supplies the United Nations estimated it needed 1,190 people , including 267 international staff and 923 Iraqi support staff .

12165
03:22:44,000 --> 03:22:45,000
Of this number 64 foreign and 598 local staff would be in the northern Kurdish provinces , no longer the direct control of the Baghdad government .

12166
03:22:45,000 --> 03:22:46,000
Another 203 international staff and 325 Iraqis would run the programme in the central and southern parts of the country .

12167
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:47,000
There are also 14 monitors to watch oil flows , 32 customs experts and four New York-based oil experts or overseers to approve contracts .

12168
03:22:47,000 --> 03:22:48,000
Yasushi Akashi , the DHA undersecretary-general , told the Security Council last week that the " financial requirements to support the ( humanitarian ) programme represent a very modest percentile of the total ...

BRUSSELS 1996-08-29

12185
03:23:04,000 --> 03:23:05,000
The European Commission said on Thursday it would study scientific reports saying Britain 's mad cow epidemic would die out by 2001 but offered little prospect the findings would change an agreed slaughter campaign .

12186
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:06,000
" Obviously we are interested in this research .

12187
03:23:06,000 --> 03:23:07,000
We will ask the ( EU ) scientific and veterinary committee to examine it , " Commission spokesman Gerard Kiely told Reuters .

12188
03:23:07,000 --> 03:23:08,000
But he added that new research into the dynamics of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) , a fatal brain-wasting disease suffered by cattle , was unlikely to alter a slaughter plan agreed by Britain and its 14 EU partners .

12189
03:23:08,000 --> 03:23:09,000
" We agreed that following detailed scientific analysis using a methodology which would take out the maximum number of BSE cases possible .

12190
03:23:09,000 --> 03:23:10,000
I think it would be very difficult to sell to the European Commission a programme which would involve the elimination of fewer BSE cases , " Kiely said .

12191
03:23:10,000 --> 03:23:11,000
" We will look at our approach ( to the plan ) but we wo n't get involved with the number of animals to be slaughtered , " he said .

12192
03:23:11,000 --> 03:23:12,000
" We have always avoided the question of numbers of animals to be slaughtered , that 's not the issue .

12193
03:23:12,000 --> 03:23:13,000
The issue is the protection of consumers ' health and the rapid eradication of BSE , " he added .

12194
03:23:13,000 --> 03:23:14,000
The reaction is likely to disappoint British farmers , who seized on research by Oxford scientists in the scientific journal Nature saying it would be hard to get rid of the disease any faster than 2001 without killing vast numbers of cattle .

12195
03:23:14,000 --> 03:23:15,000
The researchers predicted there would be 340 new infections and 14,000 new cases of BSE before 2001 .

12196
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:16,000
British farmers ' leader called on Wednesday for an urgent meeting with ministers to discuss the report .

12197
03:23:16,000 --> 03:23:17,000
" I hope the government will now make it clear they believe there is a better way of dealing with this issue , " National Farmers Union president Sir David Naish told BBC radio .

12198
03:23:17,000 --> 03:23:18,000
Naish said there was no need for Britain to carry out a planned cull of some 147,000 cattle to which it had reluctantly agreed to placate its European partners .

12199
03:23:18,000 --> 03:23:19,000
" The new evidence to me means some of that proposal should be re-examined because we could get away with considerably less animals being culled if in fact scientists throughout Europe accepted this evidence , " Naish said .

12200
03:23:19,000 --> 03:23:20,000
The report could well reopen a damaging row between Britain and the EU , which slapped a worldwide ban on British beef after the government said there could be a link between BSE and the human form of the disease .

12201
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:21,000
The issue flared in in March when government scientists admitted that people could become infected with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease ( CJD ) from eating BSE-infected beef .

Tight bowling from Glamorgan off-spinner Robert Croft helped England to restrict Pakistan to 225 for five in their 50 overs in the first one-day international at Old Trafford on Thursday .

12294
03:24:53,000 --> 03:24:54,000
Croft , who was one of the few Englishmen to make a good impression in his test debut at The Oval last week , showed great control as he first dried up the early flow of Pakistan runs and then collected the wickets of Aamir Sohail and Wasim Akram in a spell of 10-1-36-2 .

12295
03:24:54,000 --> 03:24:55,000
There was also a wicket each for Ronnie Irani , Allan Mullally and Darren Gough although there was no joy for Dean Headley who , along with Lancashire batsman Graham Lloyd , was making his international debut .

12296
03:24:55,000 --> 03:24:56,000
After Wasim had won the toss and chosen to bat first , Pakistani made an excellent start as Sohail and Saeed Anwar continued their good form with an opening partnership of 82 .

12297
03:24:56,000 --> 03:24:57,000
Anwar , who struck a superb 176 at The Oval , was the more aggressive as he made 57 from 75 balls before skying a catch off Irani to Mullally at long-on .

12298
03:24:57,000 --> 03:24:58,000
Sohail and Ijaz Ahmed then added 59 for the second wicket before England struck back with three wickets for 19 in the space of five overs .

12299
03:24:58,000 --> 03:24:59,000
First , Sohail , after making 48 , was bowled by Croft as he stepped back to try and hit through the off-side .

12300
03:24:59,000 --> 03:25:00,000
Wasim , who promoted himself to number four in the order , followed for six when Croft drifted another well-flighted delivery behind his legs .

12301
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:01,000
Shortly after Ijaz was also back in the pavilion for 48 after Irani had repaid Mullally with another good catch at long-on .

12302
03:25:01,000 --> 03:25:02,000
Gough later bowled Moin Khan with an inswinging yorker but Inzamam-ul-Haq , 37 not out , and Salim Malik took Pakistan to 225 for five when the overs ran out .

TENNIS - MARTINEZ GETS AGGRESSIVE AT U.S. OPEN .

12605
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:05,000
Larry Fine

12606
03:30:05,000 --> 03:30:06,000
NEW YORK 1996-08-28

12607
03:30:06,000 --> 03:30:07,000
Conchita Martinez decided that when in New York , do as the New Yorkers do -- and the Spaniard 's new-found aggressiveness seems to have put her in the right frame of mind for the U.S. Open .

12608
03:30:07,000 --> 03:30:08,000
The fourth-seeded Spaniard , who is tackling the world class traffic of New York City as a warm-up by driving to the tennis centre for her matches , ran over France 's Nathalie Tauziat 6-1 6-3 on Wednesday to take her place in the third round .

12609
03:30:08,000 --> 03:30:09,000
" I 've been trying my whole career to be aggressive , " said the 24-year-old Martinez after crushing Tauziat in just over an hour .

12610
03:30:09,000 --> 03:30:10,000
" What I 'm trying to do is be aggressive all the time , maybe go up to the net a few times like I did tonight .

12611
03:30:10,000 --> 03:30:11,000
That would really help . "

12612
03:30:11,000 --> 03:30:12,000
Martinez , the 1994 Wimbledon champion , used to struggle at the Open , but has come to terms with the noise , crowds and chaos .

12613
03:30:12,000 --> 03:30:13,000
" There is a lot of things that can happen , " Martinez said about her early difficulties adjusting to tennis on the cement at Flushing Meadows .

12614
03:30:13,000 --> 03:30:14,000
" Like traffic .

12615
03:30:14,000 --> 03:30:15,000
We stay in Manhattan and it 's a long way to come .

12616
03:30:15,000 --> 03:30:16,000
The crowds , they speak louder or they move .

12617
03:30:16,000 --> 03:30:17,000
That does n't happen in other Grand Slams .

12618
03:30:17,000 --> 03:30:18,000
That 's where the real champion wins .

12619
03:30:18,000 --> 03:30:19,000
You have to concentrate for these two weeks . "

12620
03:30:19,000 --> 03:30:20,000
It took Martinez four Opens to get as far as the quarters , and another four to match that .

12621
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:21,000
Last year , Martinez , who finished 1995 ranked second in the world , reached the semifinals before bowing out to Monica Seles .

12622
03:30:21,000 --> 03:30:22,000
Now she feels she is in the swing of things .

12623
03:30:22,000 --> 03:30:23,000
" I have my own car now and that helps , " said Martinez .

12624
03:30:23,000 --> 03:30:24,000
" Sometimes the transportation they ( the tournament ) provide gets a little messed up .

12625
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:25,000
This time it did n't happen .

12626
03:30:25,000 --> 03:30:26,000
I do the driving and I love it .

12627
03:30:26,000 --> 03:30:27,000
It gets my adrenalin going , those taxi drivers .

12628
03:30:27,000 --> 03:30:28,000
" We change lanes all the time in Barcelona .

12629
03:30:28,000 --> 03:30:29,000
I 'm used to it and I like to drive fast . "

12632
03:30:31,000 --> 03:30:32,000
The defending world champion Atlanta Braves , with the best record and best pitching in baseball , added another weapon Wednesday , acquiring Denny Neagle , the winningest left-hander in the National League , from the Pittsburgh Pirates .

12633
03:30:32,000 --> 03:30:33,000
The Pirates , who conceded earlier this week they would be forced to trim salary from next season 's payroll , received Ron Wright , a first baseman at Double-A Greenville ; Corey Pointer , a pitcher at Class-A Eugene , and a player to be named .

12634
03:30:33,000 --> 03:30:34,000
It was another stunning mid-season acquisition for the Braves , who already have an 11-game lead in the National League Eastern Division .

12635
03:30:34,000 --> 03:30:35,000
In the last 15 days , Atlanta has traded for third baseman Terry Pendleton , claimed outfielder Luis Polonia on waivers and called up minor-league phenom Andruw Jones , all in preparation for their fifth post-season .

BERLIN 1996-08-29

12680
03:31:19,000 --> 03:31:20,000
Olympic champions Michael Johnson and Donovan Bailey and former champion Linford Christie will run in a " Dream Team " sprint relay squad in honour of Jesse Owens on Friday .

12681
03:31:20,000 --> 03:31:21,000
Johnson , the 200 metres world record holder , and Britain 's 1992 Olympic 100 champion Christie confirmed on Thursday that they would join 100 record holder Bailey and Namibia 's Frankie Fredericks in one of the greatest 4x100 squads ever assembled .

12682
03:31:21,000 --> 03:31:22,000
They will run against quartets from the United States , Europe and Africa in a special race at the Berlin Grand Prix meeting to mark the 60th anniversary of Owens 's four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in the German capital .

12683
03:31:22,000 --> 03:31:23,000
Christie will run the anchor leg after Canada 's Bailey , American Johnson and Olympic silver medallist Fredericks have run the first three stages of the relay .

12684
03:31:23,000 --> 03:31:24,000
The participation of Bailey and Fredericks had been known before Thursday .

12685
03:31:24,000 --> 03:31:25,000
But Christie did not announce his decision to run until the eve of the meeting when organisers also confirmed Johnson would take part .

12686
03:31:25,000 --> 03:31:26,000
Christie is due to retire from international competition at the end of the season although he may compete for Britain in next season 's European Cup .

12687
03:31:26,000 --> 03:31:27,000
Although Christie , who is not racing the individual 100 metres in Berlin , took his time to agree to run , the veteran was clearly delighted to be part of the tribute to the black American .

12688
03:31:27,000 --> 03:31:28,000
When five former Olympic 100 champions from 1948 to 1980 , who have been invited to watch the race , turned up at a news conference on Thursday , Christie was quick to put his autograph book in front of the them .

12689
03:31:28,000 --> 03:31:29,000
" I do n't normally do this but can you please sign , " he said thrusting an ornate white book in front of Americans Harrison Dillard ( 1948 ) , Lindy Remigino ( 1952 ) , Jim Hines ( 1968 ) , Trinidad 's Hasely Crawford ( 1976 ) and Britain 's Allan Wells ( 1980 ) .

12690
03:31:29,000 --> 03:31:30,000
" Jesse Owens inspired everyone here and it is great to have a tribute to him . "

12691
03:31:30,000 --> 03:31:31,000
Owens 's widow Ruth is not well enough to attend but a message from her will be read out by the sprinter 's grand-daughter Gina Tillman during the meeting

12692
03:31:31,000 --> 03:31:32,000
Berlin organisers hoped to have American 1984 and 1988 champion Carl Lewis in the squad but he injured himself in last Friday 's Brussels meeting .

MILAN 1996-08-29

12695
03:31:34,000 --> 03:31:35,000
Italian soccer 's sports judge on Thursday ruled that Genoa , beaten 3-0 by Lecce in the first round of the Italian Cup , should be awarded a 2-0 victory because their opponents fielded a banned player .

12696
03:31:35,000 --> 03:31:36,000
The ruling meant that serie B club Genoa now meet local serie A arch-rivals Sampdoria in the second round .

12697
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:37,000
Genoa appealed after their defeat last Saturday on the grounds that Lecce striker Jonathan Bachini , who came on in the 71st minute with his team leading 2-0 , still had a one-match suspension to serve from last season .

12701
03:31:40,000 --> 03:31:41,000

12702
03:31:41,000 --> 03:31:42,000
A former player for Marseille and Monaco , Emon , 43 , has coached Nice since 1992 .

12703
03:31:42,000 --> 03:31:43,000
The announcement came 24 hours after the team from the French Riviera lost at home to Guingamp 2-1 in a league match .

12704
03:31:43,000 --> 03:31:44,000

12712
03:31:51,000 --> 03:31:52,000
Britain joined the United States on Thursday in welcoming Romania and Hungary 's agreement on the text of a much-delayed friendship treaty , which it said would contribute to stability in the area .

12713
03:31:52,000 --> 03:31:53,000
" The United Kingdom believes that such a treaty will contribute positively to the further development of good neighbourly relations between the two countries and enhance the stability of the region , " said the British Foreign office statement .

12714
03:31:53,000 --> 03:31:54,000
The accord , agreed two weeks ago , is expected to end years of disputes over the status of Romania 's large ethnic Hungarian minority .

12715
03:31:54,000 --> 03:31:55,000
It will also boost both countries ' ambitions to join NATO and the European Union .

12716
03:31:55,000 --> 03:31:56,000
Bucharest and Budapest say the treaty should be signed in the first half of September .

Former England rugby captain Will Carling , whose marriage broke down after he was romantically linked to Princess Diana , was divorced by his wife on Thursday , just 24 hours after Diana and Prince Charles divorced .

12730
03:32:09,000 --> 03:32:10,000
The Times newspaper said Diana was not named in the divorce petition heard by a court in Surrey , southern England .

KINSHASA 1996-08-29

12748
03:32:27,000 --> 03:32:28,000
A total of 116 delegates to Zaire 's National Election Commission ( CNE ) were formally installed on Thursday , launching another phase of the Central African nation 's much-delayed democratic transition .

12749
03:32:28,000 --> 03:32:29,000
The 116 , representing political parties in the capital Kinshasa , will help organise a voter census , a constitutional referendum planned for January and efforts to brief potential voters on what balloting involves .

12750
03:32:29,000 --> 03:32:30,000
A total of 9,446 delegates will be deployed throughout Zaire 's 11 provinces for the elections , which must be held by July 1997 under the transitional constitution .

12751
03:32:30,000 --> 03:32:31,000
Presidential , parliamentary and municipal elections are planned for May .

12752
03:32:31,000 --> 03:32:32,000
" We can meet the required deadlines for organising the elections .

12753
03:32:32,000 --> 03:32:33,000
All that is needed is for everyone to show goodwill , " Commission spokesman Yoka Lye Mudaba told reporters .

12754
03:32:33,000 --> 03:32:34,000
Delegates to the commission from the other 10 provinces will be installed progressively from next week with the provinces of North and South Kivu , Maniema , Shaba and Bandundu having priority , he said .

12755
03:32:34,000 --> 03:32:35,000
The installation of delegates was initially scheduled for July .

12756
03:32:35,000 --> 03:32:36,000
Officials said lack of funding had delayed the process .

12757
03:32:36,000 --> 03:32:37,000
President Mobutu Sese Seko , who seized power in a 1965 coup , introduced a multi-party system in 1990 but Zaire 's transition has lagged well behind that of other states in the region .

12758
03:32:37,000 --> 03:32:38,000
In the past , Mobutu has been elected without opposition .

12762
03:32:41,000 --> 03:32:42,000
Ikimi reiterated his position that the Commonwealth had no mandate to send a fact-finding mission .

12763
03:32:42,000 --> 03:32:43,000
" The request I have received is for their officials to come and talk to my officials .

12764
03:32:43,000 --> 03:32:44,000

NATO troops detained 65 Bosnian Serb policemen early on Thursday after they attacked Moslem refugees returning to homes in Mahala , a Serb-controlled village on Bosnia 's internal boundary line .

12812
03:33:31,000 --> 03:33:32,000
In apparent retaliation for NATO 's detention of the Serbs , an angry Serb mob including policemen trapped six unarmed U.N. police monitors and three local aides in their office in the town of Zvornik , east of Mahala .

12813
03:33:32,000 --> 03:33:33,000
Marriner said NATO forces confiscated 25 long-barreled AK-47 automatic assault rifles from the detained Serbs before setting them free .

U.S. envoy John Kornblum met Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on Thursday in an effort to defuse a growing crisis surrounding Bosnia 's post-war elections .

12824
03:33:43,000 --> 03:33:44,000
The American diplomat arrived in Belgrade two days after international organisers postponed municipal elections in Bosnia due to irregularities in the registration of Serb refugee voters .

12825
03:33:44,000 --> 03:33:45,000
" We discussed the decision to postpone the municipal elections and I made clear it was primarily the manipulation of voter registration by the Republika Srpska ( Bosnian Serb republic ) which led to this development , " Kornblum said after three hours of talks .

12826
03:33:45,000 --> 03:33:46,000
But he said the United States still believed it was important to go ahead with national elections in Bosnia as scheduled on September 14 to bolster the peace process .

12827
03:33:46,000 --> 03:33:47,000
Kornblum gave no indication that he had won any specific commitment from Milosevic , the patron of the Bosnian Serbs , to rectify any abuses in the registration process .

12828
03:33:47,000 --> 03:33:48,000
Bosnia 's Moslem political parties have urged their refugees to boycott the elections until irregularities with voter registration are resolved .

12829
03:33:48,000 --> 03:33:49,000
Human rights workers say Serbian and Bosnian Serb authorities coerced refugees to register only in Serb-held territory in Bosnia to solidify the results of wartime expulsions and military conquest .

12830
03:33:49,000 --> 03:33:50,000
Serbian officials have denied any abuses occurred during a 10-day registration period and the Bosnian Serbs , angry at the postponement of municipal elections , have threatened to hold local polls on their territory without the international community 's blessing .

12831
03:33:50,000 --> 03:33:51,000
Kornblum said only elections endorsed by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) would be legitimate .

12832
03:33:51,000 --> 03:33:52,000
" As we have said publicly before , if there is any effort to do so ( hold local elections ) these elections will not be valid , " he said . "

12833
03:33:52,000 --> 03:33:53,000
The elections which are valid are those conducted by the international community under the management of the OSCE . "

12834
03:33:53,000 --> 03:33:54,000
After meeting Milosevic , Kornblum flew to the Croatian capital Zagreb .

12835
03:33:54,000 --> 03:33:55,000
He was due to head to the Bosnian town of Banja Luka on Friday to meet Bosnian Serb acting president Biljana Plavsic and Bosnian Serb opposition leaders .

12836
03:33:55,000 --> 03:33:56,000
He also planned to travel to Sarajevo to oversee the formal dissolution of the separatist Croat mini-state in western Bosnia .

12842
03:34:01,000 --> 03:34:02,000
Starting price at the auction was 2,746 roubles a share and the 40 lots sold for between 2,840 and 2,998 roubles a share , the FFK said in a statement .

12843
03:34:02,000 --> 03:34:03,000
The stake represented 0.042 percent of Gazprom 's capital .

12844
03:34:03,000 --> 03:34:04,000
The FFK said that since auctions began , 139.75 million shares , equivalent to 0.59 percent of Gazprom , have changed hands .

12845
03:34:04,000 --> 03:34:05,000

12846

However , its 23.6 billion shares are highly illiquid and management permission is required to sell them .

12847
03:34:06,000 --> 03:34:07,000
Gazprom has recently tightened these rules , making it harder for shareholders to sell to whoever they want , when they want .

12848
03:34:07,000 --> 03:34:08,000
The company has organised regular auctions of its shares to create an orderly market in the paper .

At the first auction on March 6 , shares sold for an average 406.6 roubles each , and prices have been rising steadily since then , but the rise in price this week and last was much less than in previous auctions .

It was the fifth attack on police this month in the southern province , a hot spot of ethnic tension where the Albanian majority have boycotted Serbian institutions and set up their own , which are considered illegal by Belgrade .

12856
03:34:15,000 --> 03:34:16,000
The slain policeman Ejup Bajgora , 42 , was an Albanian who had served in the Serbian police and state security since 1987 , police told the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug .

12857
03:34:16,000 --> 03:34:17,000

Venezuela 's non-traditional exports , which exclude oil and iron , rose 10.6 percent in July to reach $ 334 million compared to $ 302 million in June , according to the Central Office of Statistics and Information ( OCEI ) .

12898
03:34:57,000 --> 03:34:58,000

La Nacion newspaper said the officers were suspected of demanding bribes of $ 50,000 to $ 500,000 from companies being investigated for tax evasion in order to " lose " their files .

12912
03:35:11,000 --> 03:35:12,000
The credibility of the Buenos Aires provincial police , the largest force in Argentina , has been undermined this year by scandals that included the indictment of three officers for links to the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community centre and the arrest of an entire drugs squad for drug trafficking .

12913
03:35:12,000 --> 03:35:13,000
Alberto Piotti , security chief of Buenos Aires province , told local television that 3,600 dishonest officers had been purged from the force 's ranks in the past five years .

" It is an ongoing task .

12915

Pre-electoral bickering flared on Wednesday in the troubled western Mexican state of Guerrero as some opposition politicians demanded the army pull out of the area ahead of an upcoming state poll .

12935
03:35:34,000 --> 03:35:35,000
The mayor of Acatepec , a small town some 310 miles ( 500 km ) south of Mexico City , sent a letter to Mexico 's National Human Rights Commission complaining the army 's heavy presence in the town would interfere with the Oct. 6 election .

The letter was signed by some 200 area residents and indigenous leaders .

12938
03:35:37,000 --> 03:35:38,000
Some electoral watchdog groups also said the presence of the army , which has fanned out across the state in the past month in search of a new guerrilla group , was likely to intimidate voters and had stirred up tension in the state .

12939
03:35:38,000 --> 03:35:39,000
A French group of electoral observers , Agir Ensemble pour les Droits de l'Homme , concluded the army presence exerted a heavy psychological pressure on local farmers and would prevent a fair vote .

It is not clear if the fugitive had diplomatic status in Hong Kong , and officials from the Thai Consulate were not available for comment .

12966
03:36:05,000 --> 03:36:06,000
The arrest came after the ICAC received a complaint that the man had demanded a bribe of HK$ 100,000 ( US$ 12,940 ) to issue a Thai passport , the ICAC said .

12967
03:36:06,000 --> 03:36:07,000

Thailand 's powerful military thinks the government is dishonest and Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa 's resignation might solve the nation 's political and economic woes , an opinion poll showed on Thursday .

12972
03:36:11,000 --> 03:36:12,000
Nearly half the 1,617 military personnel surveyed in the Rajapat Institute poll suggested that Banharn resign , while about 28 percent thought he should dissolve parliament and 24 percent thought a cabinet reshuffle could resolve the government 's problems .

12973
03:36:12,000 --> 03:36:13,000
Banharn , who leads a six-party , 13-month-old coalition government , faces a no-confidence debate in parliament next month .

12974
03:36:13,000 --> 03:36:14,000
The prime minister , who has already lost one coalition partner this month , is expected to have a tough battle in the debate because of infighting in his own party and warnings of more pullouts by other coalition partners .

12975
03:36:14,000 --> 03:36:15,000
The poll , conducted earlier this month after Banharn 's coalition completed one year in office , showed the military would prefer General Chatichai Choonhavan -- a former prime minister who was ousted in a military coup in February 1991 -- as prime minister .

12976
03:36:15,000 --> 03:36:16,000
Defence Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh , head of coalition member the New Aspiration Party , was the second choice for prime minister , the poll showed .

12977
03:36:16,000 --> 03:36:17,000
Banharn came in last on the list of proposed leaders with less than one percent of the votes .

12978
03:36:17,000 --> 03:36:18,000
Nearly two-thirds of the people surveyed thought the government was dishonest and insincere , and 65 percent blamed the government 's poor performance for the country 's economic slowdown .

03:36:37,000 --> 03:36:38,000
President Bill Clinton 's triumphal appearance at the Democratic convention , a vital moment in his bid for a second term , was marred on Thursday by the resignation of a top adviser in a reported sex scandal .

12999
03:36:38,000 --> 03:36:39,000
Clinton was at work on the nomination acceptance speech that will launch his 10-week re-election campaign when political strategist Dick Morris abruptly announced his resignation on Thursday .

13000
03:36:39,000 --> 03:36:40,000
The tabloid Star magazine reported the married Morris had a lengthy affair with a $ 200-an-hour prostitute who he allowed to eavesdrop on telephone conversations with Clinton , and with whom he shared White House speeches before they were made .

13001
03:36:40,000 --> 03:36:41,000
" Dick Morris is my friend , and he is a superb political strategist , " Clinton said in a written statement . "

13002
03:36:41,000 --> 03:36:42,000
I am and always will be grateful for the great contributions he has made to my campaigns and for the invaluable work he has done for me over the last two years . "

13003
03:36:42,000 --> 03:36:43,000
Morris declined to address the allegations directly in his resignation statement but said he was quitting to avoid becoming a campaign issue .

13004
03:36:43,000 --> 03:36:44,000
The surprise development captivated the thousands of reporters at the convention and clearly worried some Democrats , who had planned a triumphal celebration of Clinton 's lead over Dole in the opinion polls .

13005
03:36:44,000 --> 03:36:45,000
Senator Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat , called it a " big bump " in the way of the Clinton campaign .

13006
03:36:45,000 --> 03:36:46,000
" It comes at the worst possible time on one of the biggest days for the president , " Feinstein said .

13007
03:36:46,000 --> 03:36:47,000
Clinton was to deliver his acceptance speech at the final session of the Democratic Convention opening at 8 p.m. EDT ( midnight GMT ) .

13008
03:36:47,000 --> 03:36:48,000
The 50-year-old president has been dogged for years by allegations of financial wrongdoing , sexual misconduct and questionable judgment in selecting his advisers .

13009
03:36:48,000 --> 03:36:49,000
Republicans hope to seize on the " character " issue to bolster Clinton 's challenger Bob Dole in the final weeks of the campaign .

13010
03:36:49,000 --> 03:36:50,000
Speaking in Santa Barbara , California , Dole did not directly refer to the sexual scandal but said the departure of Morris , who had advised Clinton to chart a more centrist political course , would make Clinton drift back to the left .

13011
03:36:50,000 --> 03:36:51,000
" Morris has been trying to make President Clinton a Republican , now maybe he 'll revert to the liberal Democrat that he really is , " Dole told reporters .

13012
03:36:51,000 --> 03:36:52,000
Clinton will hit the road on Friday for a bus tour across several states in his fight to become the first Democratic incumbent re-elected to a second term since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt .

13013
03:36:52,000 --> 03:36:53,000
Aides said Clinton planned to spend most of Thursday in his hotel room several miles ( km ) from the convention hall working on his speech .

13014
03:36:53,000 --> 03:36:54,000
It was apparently neglected on his long " whistle-stop " train trip to the convention , during which he revelled in contact with friendly crowds across the country 's heartland .

13015
03:36:54,000 --> 03:36:55,000
He was also hoarse and was giving his voice a rest .

13016
03:36:55,000 --> 03:36:56,000
But first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told ABC television , " He 's really fired up . "

Clinton is leading Dole by as much as 15 points according to some polls .

13025
03:37:04,000 --> 03:37:05,000
The campaign pits Dole , a man of quick and withering wit and long-time public service , but stilted speaking style , against the glib and confident Clinton , who has perfected a style that makes direct eye contact with his audience .

Researchers report progress in muscular dystrophy .

13039
03:37:18,000 --> 03:37:19,000
PHILADELPHIA 1996-08-29

13040
03:37:19,000 --> 03:37:20,000
University of Pennsylvania researchers on Thursday said a new gene-therapy technique for treating muscular dystrophy disease had shown progress in laboratory animals .

13041
03:37:20,000 --> 03:37:21,000
Word of the findings , to be published in the Oct. 1 issue of the journal " Human Gene Therapy , " came in advance of the annual Jerry Lewis Labour Day weekend telethon to raise money for muscular dystrophy research .

13042
03:37:21,000 --> 03:37:22,000
Several hurdles must be overcome before the method is used in human trials .

13043
03:37:22,000 --> 03:37:23,000
Nevertheless , " a treatment based on the new strategy .... may have the potential to benefit many patients , " the University of Pennsylvania Medical Centre said in a release .

13044
03:37:23,000 --> 03:37:24,000
Muscular dystrophy is a fatal illness in which the body 's muscle tissue degenerates and is replaced by fat .

13045
03:37:24,000 --> 03:37:25,000
Death strikes in early adulthood .

13046
03:37:25,000 --> 03:37:26,000
Individuals with the disease have a non-working version of a gene responsible for producing a crucial muscle protein called dystrophin .

13047
03:37:26,000 --> 03:37:27,000
In the study at the University 's Institute for Human Gene Therapy , researchers altered a common-cold virus to carry a version of the working dystrophin gene .

13048
03:37:27,000 --> 03:37:28,000
The virus , which also was altered to minimise its susceptibility to the immune system , was then injected into the muscle cells of mice bred to lack dystrophin genes .

13049
03:37:28,000 --> 03:37:29,000
In the experiment , between 30 to 40 percent of the muscle fibers in one group of mice produced dystrophin for two weeks before diminishing .

13050
03:37:29,000 --> 03:37:30,000
Similar results had been obtained previously in test-tube cell cultures , but not in live animals , the university said .

13051
03:37:30,000 --> 03:37:31,000
The university said methods are still needed to make enough of the altered virus to treat humans , to further decrease the immune-system response to the virus , and to deliver the virus to human muscle tissue .

NEW YORK 1996-08-29

13082
03:38:01,000 --> 03:38:02,000
The help-wanted advertising index fell in July , the Conference Board said Thursday , reflecting the uneven nature of the nation 's labour markets .

13083
03:38:02,000 --> 03:38:03,000
The monthly index fell to 83.0 in July against a reading of 85.0 in June , the private business research group said .

13084
03:38:03,000 --> 03:38:04,000
In July , the volume of help-wanted advertising fell in five of the nine U.S. regions .

13085
03:38:04,000 --> 03:38:05,000
" The labour market has been expanding throughout 1996 , but in a very uneven pattern , " Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said . "

13086
03:38:05,000 --> 03:38:06,000
Recent want-ad figures indicate that conservative hiring plans are keeping job growth below the rate of overall economic activity . "

13087
03:38:06,000 --> 03:38:07,000
With 2.5 percent gross domestic product growth expected for 1996 , new job growth should slowly lower the unemployment rate over the rest of the year .

13088
03:38:07,000 --> 03:38:08,000
" With the unemployment rate staying close to about 5.5 percent over the last two years , there is a good chance the rate will slowly drop to about 5.0 percent by the end of the year , " Goldstein said .

13089
03:38:08,000 --> 03:38:09,000
The July index matched the reading for July , 1995 .

A second man and two women also were being sought .

13099
03:38:18,000 --> 03:38:19,000
The thefts occurred Sunday when the victim , New York jewelry wholesaler Jerry Schein , left three suitcases in a closet at Somerset Jewellers in the hotel while he checked out .

13100
03:38:19,000 --> 03:38:20,000
While he was gone , two women in their mid-twenties and an older man entered the jewelry store and tried to distract store owner Charles McGilley .

13101
03:38:20,000 --> 03:38:21,000
When Schein returned two of the suitcases were missing .

13102

O.J. Simpson said on Thursday he was financially broken by his defence against murder charges but he was hopeful new evidence to support him would be available for a civil trial next month .

13108
03:38:27,000 --> 03:38:28,000
The former football star was found not guilty by a criminal trial jury last October of the murders of his former wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend , Ronald Goldman , in June 1994 .

13109
03:38:28,000 --> 03:38:29,000
He now faces a civil suit brought by families of the victims who hold him responsible for the deaths .

13110
03:38:29,000 --> 03:38:30,000
He told reporters a court order not to talk about his case kept him from detailing how he has fulfilled his pledge to find the killers .

13111
03:38:30,000 --> 03:38:31,000
But he added without elaborating , " hopefully we will see some things come out in this next trial . "

13112
03:38:31,000 --> 03:38:32,000
The judge in the civil trial has imposed a sweeping gag order that prohibits lawyers , witnesses and parties to the case from discussing it with the media or elsewhere in public .

13113
03:38:32,000 --> 03:38:33,000
" I would love to speak about everything , " said Simpson , who vowed after his acquittal to find the killers and offered a substantial reward .

13114
03:38:33,000 --> 03:38:34,000
His lawyers have said his defence in the civil trial that starts Sept .

13115
03:38:34,000 --> 03:38:35,000
17 will be that he did not kill the victims .

13116
03:38:35,000 --> 03:38:36,000
Simpson said at the hotel news conference his plans include eventually writing another book .

13117
03:38:36,000 --> 03:38:37,000
He added that he has had job offers but more have come from abroad than at home .

13118
03:38:37,000 --> 03:38:38,000
" I 'm broke .

13119
03:38:38,000 --> 03:38:39,000
I am not crying the blues .

13120
03:38:39,000 --> 03:38:40,000
I can get along just fine , " he said . "

13121
03:38:40,000 --> 03:38:41,000
Whatever you want to send me , I need . "

13122
03:38:41,000 --> 03:38:42,000
He again accused the news media of erroneous reporting on his case but did not signal any plans for lawsuits as he did on Wednesday in an address at a jam-packed Washington church .

13123
03:38:42,000 --> 03:38:43,000
Contrary to news reports , Simpson said , he has received support from both blacks and whites .

13124
03:38:43,000 --> 03:38:44,000
He again dismissed charges that he had distanced himself from the black community during his successful football and commercial career , only to seek their support after he faced murder charges .

13125
03:38:44,000 --> 03:38:45,000
A crowd of 2,000 paid $ 10 a head to hear the former star running back for the Buffalo Bills professional football club and a Football Hall of Fame member on Wednesday night .

The crowd in the church was wildly supportive , showering Simpson with gifts and praise .

13127
03:38:46,000 --> 03:38:47,000
But outside , dozens of protesters from the D.C. Coalition Against Domestic Violence called for the church to support victims of violence instead .

13131
03:38:50,000 --> 03:38:51,000
In a written statement , distributed by the Clinton campaign , Morris avoided comment on published allegations that he had engaged in a year-long affair with a $ 200-an-hour prostitute .

13132
03:38:51,000 --> 03:38:52,000
The statement from Morris said that he had submitted his resignation on Wednesday night . "

13133
03:38:52,000 --> 03:38:53,000
While I served I sought to avoid the limelight because I did not want to become the message .

13134
03:38:53,000 --> 03:38:54,000
Now , I resign so I will not become the issue , " he said .

13135
03:38:54,000 --> 03:38:55,000
The announcement followed a report in the weekly supermarket tabloid Star magazine , reprinted in Thursday 's editions of the New York Post , that the married adviser had hired a 37-year-old prostitute on a weekly basis while visiting Washington to advise Clinton on his re-election campaign .

13136
03:38:55,000 --> 03:38:56,000
" I will not subject my wife , family or friends to the sadistic , vitriol of yellow journalism .

13137
03:38:56,000 --> 03:38:57,000
I will not dignify such journalism with a reply or an answer .

13138
03:38:57,000 --> 03:38:58,000
I never will , " his statement said .

13139

Health officials said on Thursday they were investigating the discovery of an amputated foot on a beach near Charleston to determine whether a local surgeon had improperly disposed of infectious waste .

13143
03:39:02,000 --> 03:39:03,000
The foot , which washed up on Sullivan 's Island beach this month , was amputated three years ago from a child whose legs were deformed .

The foot had to be removed so the infant could be fitted with a prosthesis .

13186
03:39:45,000 --> 03:39:46,000
Traders have said a substantial part of the deal was likely to come from the European Union , which enjoys a supply and freight advantage over other producers .

Southern California Edison Co said it expected two 220 kilovolt ( KV ) power lines in southern California to resume service later today after being shut late Wednesday because of a wildfire raging north of Los Angeles .

13283
03:41:22,000 --> 03:41:23,000
Sierra Semiconductor Corp jumped 23 percent Thursday on the expectation the company would emerge as a smaller but more profitable operation after its planned exit from the computer modem business .

13284
03:41:23,000 --> 03:41:24,000
The San Jose , Calif. , company was up 2-1/8 at 11-3/8 after its announcement Wednesday that it planned to pull out of the highly competitive modem-chip business and focus instead on the fast-growing market for computer networking equipment .

13285
03:41:24,000 --> 03:41:25,000
" Certainly the company will be a much smaller company now , but it will be a more profitable business , " said analyst Elias Moosa of Roberston Stephens & Co .

13286
03:41:25,000 --> 03:41:26,000
But analysts noted that Sierra still has much painful work ahead of it , including cutting as many as 150 jobs from its workforce , which currently has 500 people , and building up the business of its PMC-Sierra unit , which makes routing devices and chipsets for high-speed computer networks .

13287
03:41:26,000 --> 03:41:27,000
The company has announced plans to take a charge against earnings of $ 50 million to $ 80 million to write down the value of assets and inventories and cover severance payments .

13288
03:41:27,000 --> 03:41:28,000
Scott Randall of Soundview Financial Group said the company likely would have difficulty selling its modem-chip business .

13289
03:41:28,000 --> 03:41:29,000
" Once you announce your intention to exit a business , it becomes a complete buyer 's market , " he said .

13290
03:41:29,000 --> 03:41:30,000
And he said that while the company is focusing on the fastest-growing part of its business , the market for networking chips has begun to attract the attention of much-larger players such as International Business Machines Corp .

13291
03:41:30,000 --> 03:41:31,000
" As the market develops the question is , are they able to make that transition to be a much larger company ? "

13292
03:41:31,000 --> 03:41:32,000
Randall said .

13293
03:41:32,000 --> 03:41:33,000
Other analysts were more bullish , even though the company is expected to shrink to slightly more than half its current size in sales .

13294
03:41:33,000 --> 03:41:34,000
" It 's a positive strategic move , " said Miles Kan of Hambrecht & Quist .

13295
03:41:34,000 --> 03:41:35,000
" The modem business is a low-margin , commodity business , " he said .

13296
03:41:35,000 --> 03:41:36,000
The company 's PMC-Sierra unit generated $ 33 million of the company 's $ 117 million in sales in the first half of the year , compared with $ 45 million in sales of modem chips , Kan said .

13297
03:41:36,000 --> 03:41:37,000
But the PMC unit is far more profitable , he said .

13298
03:41:37,000 --> 03:41:38,000
Sierra 's stock has fallen from a high of nearly $ 25 this year as the computer chip sector has been battered by falling prices and concern about slowing demand .

Liam Gallagher , singer of Britain 's top rock group Oasis , flew out on Thursday to join the band three days after the start of its U.S. tour .

13342
03:42:21,000 --> 03:42:22,000
Gallagher made his usual obscene gestures and swore at journalists as he prepared to fly from London 's Heathrow airport to Chicago .

13345
03:42:24,000 --> 03:42:25,000
On Monday , just 15 minutes before his flight was due to depart , Liam decided not to travel with the rest of the group , which includes his brother Noel .

13346
03:42:25,000 --> 03:42:26,000
Liam caught a taxi back to London saying he had " problems at home " .

He was believed to be suffering from laryngitis and said he had to go house-hunting with actress girlfriend Patsy Kensit .

13348
03:42:27,000 --> 03:42:28,000
When they first heard that Liam had not flown out with the band at the start of the tour , many U.S. fans asked for refunds on their concert tickets .

SBC Warburg issued an update on the property sector on Thursday , saying that most of the predictions it made at the start of the year were being realised .

13359
03:42:38,000 --> 03:42:39,000
" In the property market it is a case of so far , so good , " a member of SBC Warburg 's property team said .

13360
03:42:39,000 --> 03:42:40,000
SBC Warburg said it is maintaining its forecast for five percent growth in rental incomes during 1996 , but it has shaved its forecast for capital growth to five percent from six .

13361
03:42:40,000 --> 03:42:41,000
The spokesman said SBC Warburg has also put an " add " recommendation on Slough Estates ' shares , but added that this " is a general move , not because of the results . "

13362
03:42:41,000 --> 03:42:42,000
Slough 's chairman Sir Nigel Mobbs added to the bullish mood in the sector , saying in a statement that " with the prospect of a period of steady economic growth and low inflation ahead , there is good reason to believe that the property sector should continue its improvement . "

13372

Kabariti flew by helicopter to Palestinian-ruled Ramallah and after a brief arrival ceremony went into talks with Arafat .

13373
03:42:52,000 --> 03:42:53,000
The prime minister 's visit , his first trip outside the country since Jordan was shaken by food riots earlier this month , came against the backdrop of a Palestinian general strike in the West Bank and Gaza .

13374
03:42:53,000 --> 03:42:54,000
Arafat called the four-hour strike , which ended at noon ( 0900 GMT ) to protest against Israeli policy on settlements and Jerusalem .

13375

Jomhuri Eslami quoted the West Azerbaijan province security chief as saying those held confessed to gathering confidential information , photographing strategic sites , doing propaganda against state officials and " spreading pan-Turkism " .

13380
03:42:59,000 --> 03:43:00,000
It was not clear if they were the same five spy rings , allegedly led by Turkish diplomats , that Iran said in April it had broken up in the same area , which borders Turkey .

13381
03:43:00,000 --> 03:43:01,000
The April arrests were announced shortly after a row in which Tehran asked Ankara to withdraw four Turkish diplomats accused of spying , and Turkey expelled four Iranian diplomats for their alleged links to killings of Iranian exiles .

13382
03:43:01,000 --> 03:43:02,000
Ties between the two neighbours , strained also over a military accord between Turkey and Israel which drew strong Iranian objections , have improved since Islamist Necmettin Erbakan took over as Turkish prime minister in June .

13383

The daily Iran on Thursday quoted Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahiyan as saying agents arrested 137 people for allegedly spying for Iraq , the United States and other unnamed countries in the Iranian year which ended on March 19 .

13387
03:43:06,000 --> 03:43:07,000
They said premiums on high quality jet kerosene have widened to around $ 1 , and are likely to remain strong in the near term .

13388
03:43:07,000 --> 03:43:08,000
" On the jet kerosene side we must be cautious about quality .

13389
03:43:08,000 --> 03:43:09,000
Some are commanding a very good premium of 95 cents to one dollar .

13390
03:43:09,000 --> 03:43:10,000
It 's been 99 cents to Korea .

13391
03:43:10,000 --> 03:43:11,000
This will stay at this sort of price premium for a while , " one said .

13392
03:43:11,000 --> 03:43:12,000
" But for normal jet the weakened demand is quite noticeable , the premium is around 45-50 cents .

13393
03:43:12,000 --> 03:43:13,000
The differential is not normally as wide as this , " he added .

13394
03:43:13,000 --> 03:43:14,000
Another put the premium for jet kerosene at between 65 and 75 cents .

13395
03:43:14,000 --> 03:43:15,000
One trader said despite the fact that some kerosene was in storage at Dubai ports , demand looked to exceed supply in the near term .

13396
03:43:15,000 --> 03:43:16,000
Jet kerosene was assessed at $ 27.40 - $ 27.70 a barrel fob Gulf on Thursday , up from $ 27.22 last week .

13397
03:43:16,000 --> 03:43:17,000
Dealers expected premiums to stick around current levels for the next two or three weeks , before they get a boost in the second half of September from demand for October cargoes .

13398
03:43:17,000 --> 03:43:18,000
Gas oil , assessed at $ 24.00 - $ 24.20 a barrel fob Gulf , was little changed on Thursday from last week 's $ 24.10 - $ 24.24 .

13399
03:43:18,000 --> 03:43:19,000
" On gas oil , in the near term demand and supply are balanced to a bit short , there are some enquiries into east Africa and short covering in India , " said one trader .

13400
03:43:19,000 --> 03:43:20,000
" The Indians have awarded three cargoes , but the question is whether they will come out for more , " he added .

13401
03:43:20,000 --> 03:43:21,000
India has acquired 120,000 tonnes of diesel in three cargoes , bound for the west coast , in its October tender .

13402
03:43:21,000 --> 03:43:22,000
Traders said the award could be India 's lowest in recent years .

13403
03:43:22,000 --> 03:43:23,000
" After IOC 's very small purchase of 120,000 tonnes , I 'm still suspicious that they will buy more in the second half of October , " another said .

The faded documents have been stowed away in the Archives since it opened in 1935 and have rarely seen the light of day .

13498
03:44:57,000 --> 03:44:58,000
Each soldier 's file is a gold mine of information : enlistment papers , muster rolls , medical records , discharge certificates , letters and photographs .

13499
03:44:58,000 --> 03:44:59,000
Since the project began almost two years ago , corps volunteers have focused on African American troops , preparing records in time for the unveiling in Washington this year of a special memorial to black soldiers who fought in the war .

13506
03:45:05,000 --> 03:45:06,000
Lincoln 's notation on the letter read : " If his colonel will say in writing on this sheet he is willing to receive this man back to the regiment , I will pardon and send him . "

13507
03:45:06,000 --> 03:45:07,000
The soldier was subsequently pardoned .

Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre , under fire for staging secret talks with one of the largest of several rival underground nationalist groups , told the daily La Corse in a statement he had given " firm orders " to police to round up those responsible for the bombings and bring them to justice .

13537
03:45:36,000 --> 03:45:37,000
Judges on the island had accused Paris of taking a lax stance on guerrilla violence while conducting secret but widely-reported talks with separatists which have now failed .

13538
03:45:37,000 --> 03:45:38,000
The latest bombing , close on the heels of the new orders , brought charges that police were powerless .

13539
03:45:38,000 --> 03:45:39,000
" No searches , no arrests , no police reinforcements visible on the island , despite the ministry 's promises , " the daily France-Soir lamented .

13540
03:45:39,000 --> 03:45:40,000
" On the island , as at the Place Beauvau ( the Interior Ministry 's Paris address ) , people are well aware who is who and who is doing what .

13541

It is time to end this nightly farce , " said the pro-government daily Le Figaro in an editorial .

13542
03:45:41,000 --> 03:45:42,000
No one immediately claimed responsibility for Thursday 's incidents , which brought to 23 the number of guerrilla attacks on the resort island since mid-August , when separatist guerrillas ended a shaky seven-month truce .

13543
03:45:42,000 --> 03:45:43,000
Corsica has been racked by low-level separatist-inspired violence , principally directed against government targets , for two decades .

13544
03:45:43,000 --> 03:45:44,000
The daily Le Monde reported on Wednesday some separatist movements were considering taking their attacks to the French mainland on the principle that " 300 grammes of explosives on the continent have more impact than 300 kilos in Corsica " .

13545
03:45:44,000 --> 03:45:45,000
The newspaper said separatists may take advantage of social unrest widely expected on the mainland in coming weeks over government austerity plans to stoke a popular backlash against the government .

Swedish options and derivatives exchange OM Gruppen AB said on Thursday it would open an electronic bourse for forest industry products in London in the first half of 1997 .

13549
03:45:48,000 --> 03:45:49,000
" Together with subsidiaries OMLX , the London Securities & Derivatives Exchange and OM Stockholm , OM Gruppen will open an international electronic bourse for forest products in the first half of 1997 , " OM Gruppen said in a statement .

13550
03:45:49,000 --> 03:45:50,000
The first commodity to be traded on the PULPEX bourse will be pulp , but OM said trade would be extended to include products such as timber , recycled paper and other paper qualities .

13551
03:45:50,000 --> 03:45:51,000
" Through the establishment of PULPEX , London will have a commodities bourse for forest products which complements existing bourses for oil , metals and ' softs ' ( coffee , sugar and cocoa ) , " OM said .

13552
03:45:51,000 --> 03:45:52,000
PULPEX was the result of a three-year project run in cooperation between OM and representatives of the forest industry , the company said .

13553
03:45:52,000 --> 03:45:53,000
Huge swings in the price of pulp over the past few years have made pulp producers ' profitability unpredictable , and made investing in new production capacity a risky business .

13554
03:45:53,000 --> 03:45:54,000
" Without the ability to hedge prices , changes in the world market price for pulp has had an immediate impact on players ' profitability , " OM said .

13555
03:45:54,000 --> 03:45:55,000
It said global production of pulp amounted to around 200 million tonnes per year , of which around 20 percent or 40 million tonnes was sold on the spot market .

13556
03:45:55,000 --> 03:45:56,000
At current prices , the value of this production was around $ 25 billion .

13557
03:45:56,000 --> 03:45:57,000
PULPEX will be both a marketplace and a clearing house , OM said , adding that the British Securities and Investments Board had been informed of OM 's plans .

13558
03:45:57,000 --> 03:45:58,000
PULPEX 's clearing operation will be covered by the parent company guarantee issued by OM Gruppen to its wholly-owned bourses and clearing organisations .

INTERVIEW-T&N untroubled by margin pressure .

13664
03:47:43,000 --> 03:47:44,000
LONDON 1996-08-29

13665
03:47:44,000 --> 03:47:45,000
The chairman of British-based components and engineering group T&N Plc said on Thursday the firm remained confident about the general prospects for its operating margins despite pressure from unsettled markets .

13666
03:47:45,000 --> 03:47:46,000
In an interview following its first-half results , which included a less optimistic forecast for the second half of this year than it had made in the past , Sir Colin Hope said T&N had taken defensive action to protect it from patchy markets .

13667
03:47:46,000 --> 03:47:47,000
Looking at market prospects , he said : " I think our best judgment at this stage is that it will probably bumble along in the rather mixed way it 's been in the first half . "

13668
03:47:47,000 --> 03:47:48,000
" It 's very difficult to predict the market ( trend ) this year .

13669
03:47:48,000 --> 03:47:49,000
It could be better , or it could be worse , " Hope added , echoing the demand uncertainty across automotive industries .

13670
03:47:49,000 --> 03:47:50,000
" You can see anxieties in Germany and France , in particular , beginning to grow and develop .

13671
03:47:50,000 --> 03:47:51,000
America , however , is looking a little better , " he said .

13672
03:47:51,000 --> 03:47:52,000
Compared with the end of last year , when T&N predicted a sluggish first half and a rebound later in 1996 , Hope said : " I think the difference ( now ) is the first half has not actually been as bad as some felt it was going to be , but equally we 're certainly not predicting a recovery in the second half . "

13673
03:47:52,000 --> 03:47:53,000
Against this background , Hope said the group was glad it had rationalised and destocked even though this had pressed margins , which had slipped to 9.5 percent from 11.3 percent a year ago .

13674
03:47:53,000 --> 03:47:54,000
" I think the figure of 9.5 percent on the first half , when you consider the fact that we 've been destocking , the fairly mixed customer demand , and the fact that we sold the ( southern African ) mines actually is not bad .

13675
03:47:54,000 --> 03:47:55,000
" It does show how easily we should be able to bounce back over 10 percent again , " he added , saying : " We continue to feel very relaxed about our general view that we would average 10 percent profit margins over the cycle . "

13676
03:47:55,000 --> 03:47:56,000
" We 've always taken the view that we are the sort of company that 's quite capable of working in difficult circumstances -- we 're rather used to it .

13677
03:47:56,000 --> 03:47:57,000
And we feel very confident that we 're doing all the right things , " Hope said .

13678
03:47:57,000 --> 03:47:58,000
" When the ( profit ) figures will bounce back up again is just a function of markets recovering just a fraction , " he added .

13679
03:47:58,000 --> 03:47:59,000
Commenting on the continued struggle to get control of German piston maker Kolbenschmidt , which has been hampered by regulatory obstacles , Hope said T&N 's confidence " continues to improve " that it may eventually be able to proceed .

13683
03:48:02,000 --> 03:48:03,000
An earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale shook New Zealands upper South Island on Thursday but there were no reports of injuries , Television New Zealand said .

13684
03:48:03,000 --> 03:48:04,000
It said the quake , centred near the small town of Waiau , was strongly felt in the cities of Nelson and Christchurch .

13685
03:48:04,000 --> 03:48:05,000
Some minor damage had been reported in the spa town of Hanmer .

13686

New Zealand is prone to frequent earthquakes but they rarely cause major damage .

13691
03:48:10,000 --> 03:48:11,000
Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said on Thursday he expected the territory 's economy to keep growing at around five percent but with some fluctuations from year to year .

13692
03:48:11,000 --> 03:48:12,000
Tsang , who made the remarks during a visit to New Zealand , also spoke strongly in favour of keeping the Hong Kong dollar pegged to its U.S. counterpart , and said negotiations with China on next year 's budget were going smoothly .

13693
03:48:12,000 --> 03:48:13,000
Hong Kong 's economy grew by only 3.1 percent in the first quarter , down from 5.9 percent a year earlier , and some private sector economists have revised downwards their predictions for the 1996 year .

13694
03:48:13,000 --> 03:48:14,000
Second quarter growth estimates will be released when the Hong Kong government issues its half-yearly economic report on Friday .

13695
03:48:14,000 --> 03:48:15,000
" Our trend growth rate of five percent in real terms is pretty solid , " Tsang told a news conference after meeting New Zealand Finance Minister Bill Birch .

13696
03:48:15,000 --> 03:48:16,000
" There will be fluctuations in individual years , but it wo n't be a big margin , " he said .

13697
03:48:16,000 --> 03:48:17,000
He said inflation was under control and the Hong Kong dollar was " rock solid " .

13698
03:48:17,000 --> 03:48:18,000
Its link to the U.S. dollar had proved an engine of growth for the past 12 years .

13699
03:48:18,000 --> 03:48:19,000
" There 's absolutely no economic or financial or political reason for us to change .

13700
03:48:19,000 --> 03:48:20,000
A lot of investment in Hong Kong , some of which ( is ) by China , is predicated on the link continuing . "

13701
03:48:20,000 --> 03:48:21,000
Britain will hand over Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty at midnight on June 30 , 1997 .

13702
03:48:21,000 --> 03:48:22,000
Tsang said three sets of meetings with Chinese authorities on Hong Kong 's 1997-98 budget , which will span the transition period , had gone smoothly . "

13703
03:48:22,000 --> 03:48:23,000
None of our basic precepts have been challenged . "

13704
03:48:23,000 --> 03:48:24,000
Hong Kong will retain its own currency after the handover , run its own financial and monetary policy and have control over its own foreign exchange reserves .

13705
03:48:24,000 --> 03:48:25,000
It will have no duty to contribute any taxes to Beijing , Tsang said .

13706
03:48:25,000 --> 03:48:26,000
He described the condition of the property market as " very good indeed " .

13707
03:48:26,000 --> 03:48:27,000
" You know , we went through a little climb and a little trough over the last few years .

13708
03:48:27,000 --> 03:48:28,000
Because of speculation in the market we introduced certain measures , but they are not draconian measures , and we brought it down to earth . "

13709
03:48:28,000 --> 03:48:29,000
Tsang said the market would continue to appreciate because property and land were scarce .

13710
03:48:29,000 --> 03:48:30,000
The government would put land on the market to stop rentals " going through the roof " , but this would mean reclamation , with possible environmental problems .

13711
03:48:30,000 --> 03:48:31,000
" There will be on the whole a slightly upward climb , consistent with our economic growth rate , " he said in reference to the property market .

13712
03:48:31,000 --> 03:48:32,000
Tsang , the third senior figure in the government after the governor and chief secretary , said his stated aim was to serve as financial secretary for two years under British rule and three years under China .

13716
03:48:35,000 --> 03:48:36,000
The Taiwan dollar fell in early trade on month-end U.S. dollar demand , but the downtrend was later reversed as Taiwan dollar liquidity tightened . "

13804
03:50:03,000 --> 03:50:04,000
Singapore Refining Company ( SRC ) is expected to shutdown its 60,000 barrel-per-day ( bpd ) crude distillation unit ( CDU ) in September , an industry source said on Thursday .

13805
03:50:04,000 --> 03:50:05,000
" They think something is stuck , " the source said . "

13806
03:50:05,000 --> 03:50:06,000
But nothing has been decided as they are still waiting for an X-ray machine to determine the problem . "

13807
03:50:06,000 --> 03:50:07,000
The source said the problem was discovered during the past month during which time CDU No.3 's production has varied from maximum capacity of 60,000 bpd to as low as 40,000 bpd , depending on the crude being run .

13808
03:50:07,000 --> 03:50:08,000

But by mid-August , a company spokesman said repairs had been carried out without any shutdown .

03:51:31,000 --> 03:51:32,000
For the first six months of the year , Lenzing said it posted a group pre-tax loss of 84.5 million schillings from a profit of 160 million in the year-ago period .

13893
03:51:32,000 --> 03:51:33,000
The group attributed the first-half losses to weak demand and falling prices of viscose fibres , as well as sluggish economies in the West .

Algeria , fighting a vicious war against Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas , attacked Britain on Wednesday for allowing Islamist groups to meet in London .

13898
03:51:37,000 --> 03:51:38,000
The Islamist gathering , due to be held in London on September 8 , has triggered concern and anger in several other Arab countries like Egypt which is also fighting armed Moslem fundamentalists .

13899
03:51:38,000 --> 03:51:39,000
British Jewish groups have also voiced protest because they said Palestinian Islamist Hamas as well as the banned Algerian Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) are among those radical Islamists attending the conference .

13900
03:51:39,000 --> 03:51:40,000
A foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement read on Algerian television that Algeria " has received with concern the information over a meeting of terrorist groups working against the interests of the Arab and Islamic world . "

13901
03:51:40,000 --> 03:51:41,000
" Algeria expresses its sharp rejection of a meeting putting together masterminds and ideologists and financers of terrorism , " the spokesman said , adding the Algerian government has asked the British embassy in Algiers for clarifications .

13902
03:51:41,000 --> 03:51:42,000
The Algerian ambassador in London has also asked for clarification from the Foreign Office over the meeting of Islamist groups .

13903

Wall Street ponders Rubin 's role if Clinton wins .

13912
03:51:51,000 --> 03:51:52,000
NEW YORK

13913
03:51:52,000 --> 03:51:53,000
The outcome of the November elections emerged as a hot topic on Wall Street this week as financial pundits debated whether Robert Rubin might forgo a second term as Treasury secretary if President Clinton is re-elected .

13914
03:51:53,000 --> 03:51:54,000
Concern centred on the currency markets since Rubin 's tour de force has been his unflagging support of the dollar .

13915
03:51:54,000 --> 03:51:55,000
Speculation that Rubin might not stay in his post grew after he sidestepped questions about any future Cabinet post during television interviews at the Democratic convention in Chicago this week .

13916
03:51:55,000 --> 03:51:56,000
Should Rubin leave , Wall Street would worry that he might take his strong-dollar policy with him .

13917
03:51:56,000 --> 03:51:57,000
Rubin 's predecessor at the Treasury , Lloyd Bentsen , was viewed with suspicion by some in the financial markets who thought he had tried to push down the dollar to gain an edge in trade negotiations with Japan .

13918
03:51:57,000 --> 03:51:58,000
" Obviously , under the Clinton administration , we 've seen two distinctively different dollar policies , " said Chris Widness , an international economist at Chase Securities Inc. " Under Rubin , the U.S. has certainly looked for a strong dollar . "

13919
03:51:58,000 --> 03:51:59,000
That strategy , backed up by timely instances of joint central bank intervention , helped the dollar battle back from post-Second World War lows of 1.3438 German marks on March 8 , 1995 , and 79.75 Japanese yen on April 19 , 1995 .

13920
03:51:59,000 --> 03:52:00,000
Currently , the dollar stands at about 1.48 marks and 109 yen .

13921
03:52:00,000 --> 03:52:01,000
Rubin was widely hailed as the architect of the dollar 's comeback , using skills and expertise gained in 26 years on Wall Street , part of which were spent as co-chairman of Goldman , Sachs and Co .

13922
03:52:01,000 --> 03:52:02,000
Inc .

13923
03:52:02,000 --> 03:52:03,000
" Rubin has done a fine job in that position , " said Michael Faust , a portfolio manager at Bailard , Biehl and Kaiser , which manages just under $ 1 billion in global stocks and bonds .

13924
03:52:03,000 --> 03:52:04,000
" Anyone who would come in there to replace him would have awfully big shoes to fill . "

13925
03:52:04,000 --> 03:52:05,000
Fear that a new Treasury secretary might favour a return to Bentsen-era policy could spell trouble for financial markets .

13926
03:52:05,000 --> 03:52:06,000
Some overseas investors might shy away from buying U.S. stocks and bonds or even sell them when the dollar is weakening .

13927
03:52:06,000 --> 03:52:07,000
As for U.S. Treasury securities , Widness explained that Alan Greenspan 's reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the outlook for the federal budget were more important than whether Rubin continues at the Treasury .

13928
03:52:07,000 --> 03:52:08,000
" Although , if we did get someone that was seen as looking for a dollar depreciation , it would probably hurt capital flows to the United States , " said Widness , adding that could hurt U.S. stocks and , to a lesser degree , bonds .

13929
03:52:08,000 --> 03:52:09,000
Still , markets may have little to fear from any Rubin successor because the firm dollar policy has yielded positive results .

13930
03:52:09,000 --> 03:52:10,000
If that is true , then any new Treasury chief would need to be as effective as Rubin in convincing markets that the White House does indeed want a strong currency .

13931
03:52:10,000 --> 03:52:11,000
" If he left , the first question people would ask the next guy is , ' What 's your view on the dollar ? '

" said Michael Perelstein , portfolio manager of MainStay International Funds .

13933
03:52:12,000 --> 03:52:13,000

Otherwise , you get selling out of Tokyo and Frankfurt again . "
